## English

It was the year 1580. King Suvidh Narayan ruled over the region of present-day Moulvibazar. One night, [Gangadevi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganga_(goddess)>) visited him in his dreams and asked him to dig a lake over a 12-bigha plot of land. She also left instructions to reward the first worker to dig with a gold necklace. Fearing the wrath of the Goddess, the king obliged and promptly had his men dig the lake. But alas, no matter how deep they dug, water did not come out of the ground.

At this stage, Gangadevi manifested in the king's dreams once more and demanded that his wife, Queen Komola Rani, climb down to the lakebed and offer prayers to the goddess. She also prophesized that during the prayers, water would rush to fill the lake and drown the queen. Fearing the death of the mother of his newborn child, King Suvidh kept this a secret. But Gangadevi was relentless and she managed to personally convince the queen to sacrifice herself. The next day, the prophecy played itself out. The queen offered prayers, water rushed out of the ground filling the lake and drowning her in the process. The king was devastated.

But all was not lost. That night, Queen Komola Rani appeared in the king's dream. She asked him to leave their newborn child on the lakeside every night so that she could come to breastfeed her baby. But there was a catch. The king would not be allowed to touch his wife for the next 12 years.

The king obliged and month after month he watched as the dead queen's ghost emerged from the water to breastfeed the baby. After a while, the king forgot about the warning and tried to grab his wife's saree. But the ghost promptly jumped back into the lake, disappeared and never showed up again. Since that day, one by one, all of the king's other children died under mysterious circumstances. After the last death, the king himself passed away without any heir. The whole royal bloodline was wiped out within a matter of weeks.
