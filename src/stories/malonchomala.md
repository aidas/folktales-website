There was a king named Chandra. Like all the other sorrowful kings in fairy tales, he had the same old sorrow. He had plenty of kingdom, subjects, and wealth, but he lacked only one thing: a child to brighten his home. In his yearning for a child, the king organized a grand yajna. He fasted for three days and three nights and received the fruits of the yajna. It was decreed in the yajna that the king must break his fast by eating the two fruits that would be found together on the same mango tree in the royal garden.

"Under the tender leaves, the golden fruits glisten,  

Two fruits—attached by a single stem."

The king commanded, "You must pick the two fruits while keeping them on the stem. If you succeed, you'll earn the king's shawl; otherwise, you'll face punishment!" Hearing this, no one else dared, but the palace servant stepped forward. He muttered five incantations and, shouting "Hēiyō," hurled a massive stone at the mangoes. Through the power of the spell, he succeeded. Everyone exclaimed,

"Oh, the might of the mantra!  

The king has received the fruits,  

And the servant—he gains the king's shawl!"

Everything was going well until trouble arose on the way from the garden to the palace. Once on the winged horse, the king tore off the stems and arranged the two mangoes. But fruits placed on a horse’s back can easily get swapped. No one noticed. Meanwhile, the queen was waiting in the palace, ready to eat the yagna's fruits. The king hurriedly handed her the fruit from the right side and took the one from the left for himself. The yagna’s instructions were thus violated, but no one realized it.

In this way, ten months and ten days passed. A prince was born to the king and queen, shining like a full moon in their home. Outside the birthing chamber, the maid Malini kept watch, telling tales of the kingdom to lull the queen to sleep. With the magic of the sleep-inducing aunts and relatives, everyone soon fell asleep. It was at this moment that the deities of fortune came to assess the fate of the prince.

But when they arrived, they saw that fate had turned against them! Due to the flaws on both sides, the lifespan of the prince had been reduced. It was written on his royal forehead that he would live only for twelve days. The deities were deeply saddened, but what could they do? As they prepared to leave, they accidentally bumped into Malini’s toes. Malini was the king and queen's most trusted servant, and she loved the prince more than her own life.

She insisted that the deities must reveal the prince's fate! The deities replied that all light had gone out of the kingdom. The king and queen became like stone in their grief. The elephant in the elephant stable ran away, and the horses in the horse stable died. Even the winged horse forgot to eat or drink. Seeing such sorrow among the people of the kingdom, the gates of heaven trembled. Seven days passed, and only five days remained for the prince's life.

On such a day of deep sorrow, an astrologer Brahmin arrived at the royal gate. After hearing everything, he proposed a solution. He said, if it is to be beneficial, then:

“A seven-day vow will be taken, and the bride will be twelve years old. 

If the prince marries in this manner, then the fate's curse will be broken.”

Hearing this, a rush spread throughout the kingdom as they searched far and wide for a twelve-year-old princess. Yet, they found no princess. Instead, they discovered the daughter of the Kotala, who had been the one to pluck the mangoes. Her name was Malonchoomala. She wore anklets that jingled like bees, and flowers bloomed wherever she walked. With arms like swan necks, hair like flowing waves, a nose like a flute, and a complexion of gold, she was truly a golden idol. The moon itself would feel ashamed in her presence, and she was destined to be the bride of Prince Chandramanik.

Three truths were asked, and Malonchoomala became the queen of the royal house. However, fate had written a different story, and the prince’s life slipped away in the wedding chamber. In a fit of rage and sorrow, the king sought vengeance on the Kotala. Meanwhile, the newly widowed Malonchoomala faced a cruel fate: her head was shaved, she was covered in mud, and her eyes were gouged out as punishment.

All the punishments endured, Malonchoomala took her infant husband to the center of the funeral pyre, asking the king for a boon. The rain drenched the pyre, and spirits and ghosts came, yet none dared approach her. She sat resolutely with her child in her lap. The demons and old women of the cremation ground begged, “Oh Malonchoo, don’t give him to us! Let us feast in peace.” But she ignored their pleas, remaining steadfast. Even the messengers of death, Kaladut and Shaladut, circled from afar, unable to sway her resolve.

Quite some time passed, with no sense of time. Suddenly, a beautiful girl resembling Malonchomala appeared, laughing as she approached. She tossed her hair aside and called out, “Oh Malonchoo, you are my dear friend! With the medicinal herbs of the forest, I can bring your husband back to life.”

There, she encounters a tiger. The tiger, as tigers do, lunges forward with a growl, intent on devouring the child. But Malonchomala isn’t one to back down easily. Having just returned her husband from death, she refuses to let him fall into the tiger's claws. She boldly says, “Look, tiger. This is my husband. Eating him won't satisfy your hunger. Why don’t you eat me instead?”

Hearing this, the tiger felt a pang of sadness. He took Malonchomala and ChandroMaanik to his home, where he lived happily with his tigress wife. Malonchomala affectionately called the tiger "uncle" and the tigress "aunt," and they cared for the two as if they were their own children. Thus, five years passed. One day, Malonchomala said, “Uncle and Aunt, it's time for me to say goodbye.”

With tears in their eyes, the tiger and tigress bid farewell to Malonchomala. She arrived at a desolate garden, with the creamy-white palace of a king in the southern direction. As soon as she stepped into the garden, it burst into life with buzzing bees, and flowers, vines, and leaves adorned the trees. The fragrance of the blossoms filled the air, and from within the house emerged the garden's caretaker, Malini. “Who are you, dear? Your touch has brought such fragrance to the garden! Come in, come inside.”

From then on, they lived in Malini's house. Malonchomala didn't reveal her identity for fear of incurring the king's wrath again; this felt safer. Chandromani grew up and attended school, but Malonchomala stayed away, afraid that he might call her “Mother.” She cooked for him, and Malini would take the food to him, ensuring he was well-fed while keeping their secret safe.

Thus, seven years passed. In the land of the milky-white king, he had seven sons and one daughter named Kanchanmala. Chandromani attended the same school as the king’s children, and his talents were unmatched. The king's sons burned with jealousy upon seeing Chandromani's exceptional abilities. But Kanchanmala had different thoughts; she was almost infatuated with Chandromani's beauty and talents. She scribbled his name on paper and sang softly about him:

“In his hands, the moon shines bright,  

On his feet, the moon’s pure light,  

Countless moons rise and fall,  

Yet his face outshines them all.”

The final exams at the school concluded, and in the last race, Chandromani outpaced the king’s sons on his swift steed. But as the victory garland was about to be presented, an extraordinary event occurred. There sat Kanchanmala, the princess, atop the golden spire of the royal palace, weaving a fragrant garland with her own hands. She tossed the garland into the air, and it landed around Chandromani's neck. With the princess's garland draped upon him, the jealousy of the seven brothers bubbled beneath the surface, but they united to take him to the royal court.

But no one knew that he was the son of the king—not the son of Malini. The white king was furious. How could the princess adorn the son of a maid with a garland? This was an absolute calamity! Having garlanded him, the marriage was deemed confirmed. After three days and nights of celebration, on the fourth day, Chandromani was shackled and sentenced to twelve years of punishment. They locked him away, banishing the son of the moon to the dungeons.

Meanwhile, Malonchomala hears all the news from the peacock. She rolls in the dust by the edge of her lake, and the moon in the sky completely hides behind clouds in her sorrow. It is said that in Bangladesh, on the fringes of Tangail-Savar, lies the lake imbued with the memory of a sorrowful maid's daughter, known as "Malonchomala's Dighi," a place steeped in the fragrance of fairy tales.

"Though he was destined to live only twelve days, today marks the completion of twelve years. In the house of the fair king, Chandramanik will receive a royal bride. Princess Kanchanomala, most beautiful of all, shall be his wife, thus lifting the shadow of misfortune."

Malancho, having handed the letter to the bird, sat down and wept. However, she had yet to hear the real news. She believed her husband was happily living with the princess. But neither she nor the bird knew about the imprisonment. With a heavy heart, Malancho decided to return to her parental home. She thought to herself:

"In the sea where I found a gem, in that land where I lost my father—  

In the waters of that sea, my heartache shall be washed away."

The road ahead was filled with thorns and sharp stones. As Malonchomala traveled, she encountered her tiger uncle and aunt in the forest. The tiger, knowing all the news of that land, informed Malonchomala, "A garland around the neck? If the prince of the kingdom marries into the house of a gardener, then that groom must wear chains for twelve years. This is the law of this land."

Upon hearing everything, Malonchomala realized that it was up to her to save Chandramanik. With this thought, she made her way to the ivory-hued king’s prison, where the prince was imprisoned for twelve long years. Around his neck was not the wedding garland, but a strong iron chain. Malonchomala spent day and night there, trying to bite through the iron shackles with her teeth. It seemed impossible—but in fairy tales, anything can happen.

"One watch, eight teeth lost—one layer of the shackle was cut.  

Four watches passed, and four layers of chains were undone."

When Chandramanik awoke, he found himself free. He hadn't noticed that Malonchomala lay there, exhausted and worn.

Now it was time for Malonchomala's maternal family, the tigers from the jungle, to act. They descended upon the land of the fair-skinned king and laid it to waste. The grandeur of the royal palace, the horses, the elephants—nothing was left uneaten. Perhaps even the king and queen would not have been spared if not for Malonchomala's request. Only the princess Kanchanmala, known as Kanchi, was spared, along with the rest of the royal family. Malonchomala had only one plea—to let her husband live in peace!

No teeth, no king, no house, no home—yet Malonchomala's heart is at peace, for Chandramanik is free! After many years, the king was reunited with his prince. His joy knew no bounds. Plans were made to return to their own kingdom immediately. The palanquin, horses, and chariots were all arranged. But alas, what about Malonchomala? No one seemed to care about her. Poor Malonchomala was left behind, sitting by the roadside. Her only companions were the tiger, tigress, and Malini from the land of the milk-white king. They all came to lift her up and comfort her.

Meanwhile, the king, along with Kanchanmala and Chandramanik, returned to the kingdom with great fanfare, accompanied by the beating of drums. Malonchomala followed behind them, sneaking glances into their home from time to time, checking on how her husband and his new bride were faring. One day, however, she was caught in the act. Chandramanik demanded to know her true identity. After all those years of keeping her secret, Malonchomala finally had to reveal who she was. Yet, knowing the truth brought no salvation—no sooner had she confessed than the king’s guards arrived and seized the unfortunate Kotal's daughter.

Once again, Malonchomala was forcibly exiled from the kingdom. The moment her feet crossed the boundary, chaos descended upon the realm. The palace gates crumbled, stars fell from the sky, and fires erupted in the distance. Even in the royal chambers, where seven sons were born to the prince, none survived beyond their infancy. Meanwhile, wherever Malonchomala walked, flowers bloomed in her wake, filling the air with their sweet fragrance.

Days passed in this manner. Malonchomala now lived deep in the forest, far from the royal palace. But her fate was still tied to that of the kingdom—could she truly escape it so easily? One day, the king went out for a hunt. In the midst of his expedition, he lost his way. No matter which direction he took, it felt like he was trapped in a labyrinth. As he wandered, the king grew weary and finally knelt down, calling out in a sorrowful voice, "Water, just a little water!"

From a dilapidated yet beautifully arranged cottage in the forest emerged a stunning girl. Just seeing her seemed to quench one’s thirst and cool the mind. She approached the king slowly and offered him a vessel of icy-cold water. Grateful for the refreshing drink, the king asked, “Who are you, dear? How did you come to give me water in this dense jungle? I have never seen you before.”

With a sweet smile, Malonchomala introduced herself to the king, embodying a purity untouched by her hardships. Overcome with embarrassment, the king lowered his gaze. He immediately wished to take her back as the queen of his kingdom. However, Malonchomala explained that her home was now in the forest. The king insisted on not letting her go, asking for forgiveness for all his past wrongs, stating that this time she must come with him!

Then Malonchomala went to bid farewell to her uncle and aunt in the forest, as her long wait was finally over. Overjoyed, she sprinkled the oil of seven lamps over the remnants of those who had perished. One by one, everyone in the kingdom revived. Flowers bloomed on the trees, and birds began to sing. With Malonchomala’s touch, the land experienced an eternal spring. It seemed as if she held the power of life and death in her hands!
