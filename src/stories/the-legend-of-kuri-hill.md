Centuries ago, there was a renowned market called Imambazar, located in the present-day district of Habiganj. Among other things, the market was well-known for its fish shops. However, there was one unpleasant aspect of Imambazar - a nearby garbage dump where people would throw away discarded fish pieces. Every day, someone would come and collect the fish pieces, but no one bothered to find out who this person was. No one, except for an infamous robber named Shamsu Miah.

One evening, after the market had closed for the day, Shamsu Miah secretly began observing. After a while, a Dervish (দরবেশ) dressed in white clothes approached the garbage dump. The curious robber watched with keen interest as the dervish picked up the fish pieces, put them inside his bag, and started walking away. Shamsu Miah began to follow him. The dervish walked to the top of a nearby hill and stopped in front of a giant black rectangular slab of rock. Then, as if by magic, the rock slid to the side and revealed an illuminated tunnel. The dervish casually walked into the tunnel and left the door open. Shamsu Miah hesitated to go in, but the open door was too much of a temptation. He gathered all his courage and followed the dervish inside.

Inside the tunnel was a cave that reminded Shamsu of the story of Aladdin from The Arabian Nights. The whole place was adorned with gold and jewels, like a royal palace. Even the air smelled of sweet fragrance. Shamsu hid behind a rock and watched with awe as seven dervishes gathered around a dining table. The man he had followed from the dump reached inside his bag and pulled out something. But instead of rotten fish, all sorts of delicious food items came out. After setting up the table, the dervish announced that a guest would be joining them and called out to Shamsu Miah. The mighty robber was scared out of his wits. He appeared from behind the rock and joined the dervishes at the table. The old men assured him that they meant no harm and offered him a variety of delicacies. The food was better than anything he had ever tasted in his entire life. After dinner, the dervishes walked him back to the tunnel entrance and told him that he was welcome anytime as long as he kept it a secret.

This incident completely changed Shamsu Miah. He gave up robbery and became a pious man. His family began to wonder what had happened to him and pestered him with questions. But Shamsu held on to his secret as long as he could. Finally, his mother, on her deathbed, asked him to tell the truth as her last wish. With no way out of the situation, Shamsu shared the story of the cave of the seven dervishes. And surely, within three days of the death of his mother, Shamsu himself passed away.
