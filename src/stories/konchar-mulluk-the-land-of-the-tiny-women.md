Long ago, in the village of Bhonar Para in Tangail, there was a buzz about a young man who had returned from a strange place called Kochhar Mulluk. No one could pinpoint the exact year, but the villagers were eager to hear his story.

When questioned, the young man described Kochhar Mulluk as a peculiar land, inhabited solely by women. Teenagers, young women, and elderly alike - there were no men to be found anywhere.

The young man had visited Kochhar Mulluk in his youth, when he used to wander the village playing the leaf-flute and singing love songs. That was when a group of captivating water gypsies arrived, all beautiful women skilled in the art of snake charming. Their alluring gazes seemed to hold the secrets of the world. Their behavior and mannerisms were vastly different from the village brides and maidens.

Some of these snake charmers shared a single husband, who spent his days sleeping in their boats. Others were not yet married. Yet, they seemed unbothered, speaking of mystical amulets that piqued everyone's curiosity. These amulets could seduce a newlywed groom, tame an aloof husband, suck out poison, exorcise ghosts, and even cast protective spells.

Aside from the talisman buyers, the enthusiastic local youths were always captivated by the alluring water gypsies. One such young man was known only by the curious name Rongi-Dhongi, though his true identity remained a mystery to the villagers.

Rongi-Dhongi's gaze was instantly ensnared by a mesmerizing 14-year-old gypsy girl, whose skin glowed with an enchanting shimmer and whose eyes held a magical allure. It was love at first sight for the young man.

Their courtship unfolded over the course of several days. Rongi-Dhongi would linger near the girl, exchanging glances and playing soulful tunes on his flute, his body swaying gently to the rhythm of his love songs. The girl, whose name was Shukla Chaturdashi, was a vision of ethereal beauty, like the radiant moon on a cloudless night.

One evening, Shukla Chaturdashi approached Rongi-Dhongi of her own accord. She offered him a drink and tied an amulet around his neck. The potion's effects soon took hold, and Rongi-Dhongi drifted into a deep, dreamlike slumber. When he finally awoke, he found himself utterly disoriented - the boat had already left the shores of his village, and he had no sense of direction.

Days and nights blurred together as the boat drifted along the winding Yamuna-Brahmaputra rivers. Little by little, Rongi-Dhongi started to regain his bearings, only to find that the surrounding landscape had changed dramatically. The people were smaller in stature, and they spoke in a strange, unfamiliar tongue called "Kilimili Ilimili." Yet, as he scanned the area, Rongi-Dhongi saw not a single man, only an endless sea of captivating women.

After the boat reached the shores of this mystical, unfamiliar land, Rongi-Dhongi was immediately offered a glass of special sherbet, said to be brought from the renowned land of magic, Kamrup Kamakhya. This syrupy concoction, infused with tantric power, instantly imbued Rongi-Dhongi with the strength of a hundred horses - a vitality he had never experienced before.

That very night, Shukla Chaturdashi formally wed Rongi-Dhongi, the ceremony marked by an exchange of garlands. What puzzled the young man, however, was Shukla's behavior afterward - she proudly announced their marriage to everyone, a custom that seemed most unusual to Rongi-Dhongi. "Of course, everything is a new rule after coming to this land of snake charmers," he mused.

Rongi-Dhongi's days after the wedding were not unpleasant. He could eat and rest as he pleased, occasionally playing his leaf flute. He was in awe of the wonders of this strange new world, though sometimes he was required to hide in a hole against his will. Whenever the ground rumbled with an earthquake, his in-laws would rush him into a hiding pit. And if a tiger's roar echoed nearby, he had to return to his subterranean refuge. Rongi-Dhongi disliked being confined in the hole, but was told that if he failed to hide, his very manhood could be at risk. Occasionally, Rongi-Dhongi was permitted to venture out, but his wife never left his side, lest someone else try to take him away. "Is there a better man in this country?" they exclaimed. Rongi-Dhong was left perplexed by the customs of this peculiar land. Rongi-Dhongi's wife, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law spent their leisure time chewing on betel leaves, conversing and singing in a strange, unfamiliar language.

One day, while the family was away at the market, Rongi-Dhongi ventured out a bit. He came across a beautiful deer at the edge of the courtyard, and followed it to a large birch tree. There, he discovered a group of captivating women bathing in a nearby pond. Spotting him, the women cheered and eyed him up and down, chattering amongst themselves, "This must be the groom from the land of the tides!" Without waiting for his consent, the women roughly dragged Rongi-Dhongi back to their home, much like his in-laws' dwelling. He was taken there and kept under strict guard, hidden away in the attic with the ladder removed. Wherever he looked, the women seemed to invite him seductively, filling Rongi-Dhongi with growing fear. These new women paid him little heed, but he remained terrified nonetheless. One spun yarn, another sewed lungis and fatuas, but none asked him to work. They simply fed him like a pet, only bringing him down from the attic when they desired his company, then returning him to his secluded perch afterward.

After a few days, Rongi-Dhongi's disappearance had become known in his in-laws' home. A search eventually led them to the people holding him captive, and a fierce altercation ensued in their strange language. In the end, Rongi-Dhongi was brought back home, though the guard over him was increased a hundredfold. During the day, he was allowed to eat and drink, but at night, he was made to consume the Sanjeevani Sudha, a vitality drink from the magical land of Kamarupa Kamakhya. Years passed, and each year, Rongi-Dhongi's wife gave birth to twin girls, filling the household with daughters. It seemed that boys were not born in this peculiar country, which is why all eyes remained fixed upon Rongi-Dhongi.

After a few years, Rongi-Dhong finally snapped out of his dazed state. He realized he could not spend the rest of his life as a mere slave. Longing to return to his own village, where he once roamed freely without restriction, Rongi-Dhong decided to make a daring escape. The opportunity presented itself one day when Rongi-Dhong went for a walk with his wife. He spotted the same beautiful women who had abducted him earlier and called them over. When his wife was busy shopping, he propositioned the women, saying, "Will you go to my country? There will be many men there." Delighted by this offer, the three beauties agreed to Rongi-Dhong's plan. They made arrangements for a boat to leave that very night, with Rongi-Dhong leading the way.

By this time, Rongi-Dhong had fathered six daughters. Under the cover of night, while everyone was sleeping, he seized the chance to escape. Slipping out of his hiding place, he ran straight to the jetty, where the waiting women joined him. Together, they embarked on their journey in the dead of night.

After two or four days, they passed by another village, leaving the distant memory of Kochhar Mulluk behind. As they traveled, the number of men gradually increased, much to the awe of the beautiful women in the boat. Suddenly, Rongi-Dhong recognized his familiar surroundings - this was the land of the tides, his own village! Filled with joy, he watched as the group of snake charmers tied the boat to the jetty that night, using the opportunity to make a final break for freedom.

The villagers were stunned upon hearing Rongi-Dhong's extraordinary tale, unsure whether to believe the wild account. A curious girl then asked, "What will you do now?"

Rongi-Dhong replied with a smile, "What else is there to do? I have learned many mantras during my time in Kochhar Mulluk. From now on, I shall be the shaman of this village."

The villagers were unsettled by the change in Rongi-Dhong, who seemed much older than his years. There was a heavy weight in his eyes, a lingering burden from his harrowing experience in Kochhar Mulluk.
