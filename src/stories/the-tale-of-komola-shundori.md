# Plot Summary

## English

In the late 8th century, the vast [Gauda Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Gauda) was beginning to fracture, giving rise to numerous smaller kingdoms. During this time, the ruler of [Pundranagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundranagar) was King Jayanta. A beloved and just ruler, adored by his subjects.

Meanwhile, [King Vinayaditya Jayapira](https://www.jatland.com/home/Jayapida) of Kashmir, having conquered several territories, set his sights on Gauda. His next target was Pundranagar. However, before launching an attack, he wanted to thoroughly assess the battlefield. Disguised and under the cover of night, he wandered through the city, unnoticed by anyone. As he moved through the streets, he carefully observed and assessed the state of the kingdom, preparing for the battle ahead.

As Jayapira wandered through the city, he eventually found himself in the courtyard of the Skandhamandir. There, a dance was taking place, captivating everyone around. And why wouldn’t they be mesmerized? It was the performance of Kamala Shundori, the most renowned dancer in the kingdom.

“Come, see for yourselves...

Kamala dances, pausing with grace!”

Jayapira joined the crowd, watching intently. The sound of anklets resonated with the rhythm of the dance, echoing in the air. At one point, the anklets stopped. Kamala, the dancer, prepared a betel leaf and offered it to Jayapira. The regal manner of a king in which he accepted it, even in disguise, betrayed his true identity. Jayapira took the betel leaf from her hand with the grace of a king. In that instant, Kamala realized who he truly was. Yet, she said nothing. The first sight of Jayapira had captivated her so deeply that she couldn’t bring herself to put him in danger.

That very night, they met in secret. Kamala's love for her kingdom was boundless, yet Jayapira was the enemy of that very land. But how can the heart be restrained? Their love blossomed like a full moon illuminating the sky of Pundranagar. Kamala, the dancer, found herself caught in a painful dilemma, torn between her love for her country and her love for Jayapira. It was a situation where loss and sorrow awaited on both sides. What could she do? She was at a loss. All she could do was gaze into Jayapira's eyes and hear the ancient melody of anklets echoing in her heart.

What a twist of fate! Just as Jayapira entered the kingdom, it was besieged by a ferocious lion. The beast terrorized everyone, young and old alike, with daily casualties. The fear of the lion had paralyzed the kingdom; no one dared to move freely for fear of being taken by the beast. With no solution in sight, King Jayanta made a proclamation: whoever could slay the lion would be granted the hand of the princess in marriage.

Jayapira hasn't yet heard of this news. To save both the kingdom and Jayapira himself, Kamala devised a plan. She approached Jayapira and said, “There is no one in this kingdom who can defeat the lion except you. You are a noble king—please save my country from the beast!” Unable to ignore Kamala’s plea, Jayapira agreed to help. His intention was to deal with the lion swiftly and then return home as soon as possible.

Jayapira quickly subdued the lion, but he was astonished when Kamala threw a ring with his name engraved on it at the lion’s face. With a wry smile, Jayapira remarked, “So this is how you plan to reveal the enemy?” Kamala didn’t respond; she simply cried and wept. Seeing her distress, Jayapira’s heart softened. That night, he chose not to return to his own kingdom.

By morning, the kingdom was in uproar. The news spread far and wide— the lion had been slain! The brave hero who had defeated the beast was none other than ‘King Jayapira of Kashmir.’ The king, overjoyed, summoned Jayapira and honored him with his daughter’s hand in marriage. The night in Pundranagar turned into a grand celebration, filled with music and revelry.

In the courtyard of the Skandhamandir, not a single lamp was lit. The dancer’s anklets were silent, and she lay in a disheveled state. Both the kingdom and love were saved, but Kamala Shundori’s heart was broken. Although Jayapira later came to visit her, it is said that on that day, in the Skandhamandir, Kamala placed a garland around Jayapira’s neck.

Two miles south of [Mahasthangarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasthangarh), on the west bank of the Karatoya River, lies the Skandhamandir. Though now in ruins, with no remnants of its original bricks, stones, or carvings, the site is still known by names like ‘Skandher Dhap’ or ‘Kartik’s Dhap’. The significance of this place is mentioned in texts such as ‘[Karatoya Mahatmya](https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/corpustei/transformations/html/sa_karatoyAmAhAtmya.htm)’ and ‘[Rajatarangini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajatarangini)’. Historically, the temple was a venue for dance and music performances, and many historians believe that some of Bengal’s earliest plays were staged here.
