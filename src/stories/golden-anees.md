Once upon a time, there lived a kind and noble king. Despite having a powerful army and great wealth, there was a void in his life, for he had no children. Over the years, the king had married seven different queens, but to his sorrow, none of them could give him a child. He sought counsel from healers and saints across the kingdom, but no remedy could be found. In his desperation, the king decided to venture into the dense jungle in search of answers. His seven queens pleaded with him not to go, but he set off with nothing but the clothes on his back.

After months of wandering in the wild, the king encountered a wise sage (মুনি) deep in meditation. Falling to his knees, the king begged the sage for a solution. The sage, initially unwilling to help, threatened to cast a curse. However, the king's repeated pleas eventually moved the sage's heart. He revealed the secret of an enchanted banana tree hidden in the heart of the forest. To bless his queens with children, the king must gather seven bananas from this magical tree. The sage, though, required a price for this knowledge: one of the king's sons in twelve years' time. The king considered the sage's offer, thinking that having six children was worth the cost of one. He returned to his palace with the enchanted bananas and followed the sage's instructions.

Twelve years passed, and the king was now the father of seven handsome princes. His favorite was Anees, the youngest. But when the sage came to collect his due, Anees was the chosen one. With a heavy heart, the king watched as the sage and his beloved son, Anees, disappeared into the jungle.

They walked for days until they reached a secluded area with a small hut by a large tree. It was well past sunset when they arrived, and the sage advised Anees to make his bed inside. Throughout the night, wild animals called out, but the sage assured him that the hut was protected by a powerful spell.

The following morning, Anees awoke to discover that the sage had already departed for his daily meditation. He decided to explore his surroundings, and what he stumbled upon filled him with dread. The nearby area was scattered with numerous human skulls. "There must be a man-eating tiger in this jungle," Anees thought with a shiver. Suddenly, an unexplained voice called out to him. He scanned the surroundings but found no one. The voice beckoned again, and Anees realized it coming from a skull resting on the ground. The skull disclosed that there were no man-eating tigers in the jungle. Instead, the sage collected someone from a neighboring kingdom every year and offered them as a human sacrifice to the gods in exchange for his magical powers. The young prince welled up with tears at the prospect of impending doom. The skull consoled the distressed lad and provided him with counsel on how to evade his fate.

On the day of the sacrifice, the sage instructed Anees to bathe in a nearby pond filled with oil. He followed the sage's guidance and reached the spot. There were indeed two ponds, one containing oil and the other filled with milk. Remembering the skull's advice, Anees bathed in the pond filled with milk, avoiding being turned into a sacrificial goat. When Anees returned to the hut, the sage realized his plan had failed. He tried to seize Anees, but the young prince was too quick. Anees locked the sage inside and fled into the jungle, where he followed the skull's instructions to collect three vital items from the sage's temple: a resurrection stone (জীয়ন পাথর), an invisibility cap (গায়েবি টুপি), and a talismanic ring (তিলিশমাতি আংটি).

Afterward, Anees proceeded to a nearby well, where he gathered a bucket of water and cleansed the resurrection stone with it. He then returned to the location where he had initially found the skulls and splashed the water in all directions. Almost instantly, the bones began to rattle and, within moments, their flesh and muscles miraculously regenerated. All the people who had fallen victim to the sage's sacrifices were brought back to life. Having repaid the skull for saving his life, Anees embarked on his journey back home.

On his way, the young prince rested by a riverbank and fell asleep. He awoke to the sound of horses and saw a chariot (রথ) descending from the sky, carrying seven beautiful fairies (পরী) who had come to bathe in the river. Not wanting to startle them, Anees put on his invisibility cap and watched from the water. He was entranced by their beauty, particularly the youngest fairy. Startled, Anees bumped into her, causing her to spill water on his face and making him visible. The fairies were repulsed by the mortal behaving like a peeping Tom. Furthermore, according to fairy customs, allowing a man to drink water from your hands sealed a marital bond. Despite their reluctance, the fairies brought Anees with them to their kingdom. Their father, the king of the fae, felt embarrassed and initially declined to publicly bless the marriage. He subjected the human prince to a series of challenging tests to assess if a mere mortal was worthy of his daughter. Fortunately, aided by his talismanic ring, Anees effortlessly passed each test. Eventually, the king relented and approved of the union. Anees then recounted his entire story to his new wife and father-in-law. Hearing this, the king of the fae took pity on the young lad and ordered his royal chariot to transport the human prince and his fairy wife back to his parents.
