Many years ago, in a region adjacent to the Sundarbans called Tala-Kalaroa, there was a village named “Sujan Saha”. The villagers were suffering from a severe lack of water. A kind-hearted man from the village named Sharaf Khan decided to address the issue by digging a large pond. Work began on the pond, but as the project progressed, news reached the king.The king lives in a nearby village.In the capital of Manikhar. The king was furious when he heard about the pond being dug.

"A pond is being dug in my kingdom, without informing me? I'll deal with this."

As the king went to halt the pond's construction, a divine message reached his ears: "O foolish king, have you forgotten your past? If you value your life, stop immediately." The king was taken aback, and a forgotten chapter of his past came rushing back to him.

The king then approached Sharaf Khan and said, "I didn't realize my kingdom was facing such trouble. I want to help you with this project." With that, the king donated a significant amount of wealth to the pond's construction. The excavation was completed ahead of schedule. It was a rainy day, and on top of that, it was a huge thirty three-acre pond. The people of the village thought that now the problem of water will be solved. But even in such a deep lake, not a single drop of water is seen. Any water that accumulated disappeared quickly, and the villagers' problems persisted. They soon discovered the cause of this issue.

It is a weekend market in the village. The pond was the main topic of conversation. No one could find a solution. Then, one person said, "Hey! Tior King has a curse on his forehead! There is no water in the pond because of him.!" “What did you say, brother?” they asked, but the man who said it could not be found anywhere. However, everyone became furious with King Tior.At first, there was laughter, whispering, and murmuring. Then, the suppressed anger against the king emerged. As people talked, more words were exchanged, and the king's hidden history was revealed to everyone.

"What is that history?" someone asked.

"Oh, you don't know? The king isn't a true royal. He was once a sailor's son named Tepa Majhi. Many years ago, he used to ferry people for trade. One stormy day, no one wanted to board his boat except for an old man named Vinod Bamun. Tepa insisted on taking him across the river."

"Why did he insist so much?"

"The sailor's son had evil intentions. Vinod Bamun was a great man and carried a magical stone called Parashmani that could turn anything to gold. Tepa knew this and seized the opportunity. He threw Bamun into the river and stole the Parashmani. With its power, Tepa became the king. But before he died, Vinod Bamun cursed him, saying that one day the people of the kingdom would turn against him. And now it seems that curse is coming true."

Many such conversations took place. The market dispersed, and people returned home, but their anger and resentment towards the king did not lessen. The words reached the king's ears as well. Overwhelmed with worry, he seemed to have stopped eating and drinking. The sins of killing the Brahmin and his deceit weighed heavily on him. Now, people were also denouncing him. Despite being a king, Tior Raja found no peace in his life. The king then thought it was necessary to atone for his sins. The truth was, he was no longer attached to wealth. He had received and enjoyed much in life. What more could he gain in this final stage of life? So, he opened the royal treasury to all the poor and needy. People took whatever they needed. But even this did not bring peace to his mind. The king still couldn't sleep at night, and the pond still had no water.

A few days later, the king received another divine message in a dream: "Do you think giving away your wealth at the end of your life will earn you virtue? Listen, foolish king—if you want to bring water to the pond, someone must sacrifice their life for it. Only then will the problem be solved. Think about it, what will you do?"

The king was now in such a state that he wouldn't regret giving his own life. But asking someone else to do so? Another life? The king was lost in a sea of thoughts. He had committed only sins his whole life. Would anyone else give their life for him? Still, there was no harm in trying. He approached relatives, friends, even the officials of the kingdom, humbling himself and begging for a life. But what greater wealth is there than life itself? No one was willing to give up their life in exchange for wealth.

Then, to atone for his sins and to help the villagers, the king went once more to the kind-hearted Sharaf Khan’s house. The king, for the last time, shared his sorrow with him. After that, the king didn’t need to say anything more. Sharaf Khan, without any demand for money, prepared himself to sacrifice his life in the pond for the king and the people of the kingdom. The king was humbled by Sharaf Khan’s kindness. His long-held royal pride crumbled into dust. Sharaf Khan said, “Return to the palace, King. I will be present at the pond tomorrow morning.”

The news spread quickly. The next morning, Sharaf Khan went to the center of the pond, took a deep breath, and began to dig. As he did, a fountain of water erupted, and Sharaf Khan began to sink. His family rushed to save him, but they too were swallowed by the water. The entire Khan lineage disappeared into the pond of water. It was the curse of Khandal Tior King. Only Sharaf Khan's elderly mother survived, wailing at the pond's edge crying and yelling, ""O cursed pond! You have swallowed my children and my grandchildren (Puri)!"!" Since then, the pond has been known as 'Purikheko Dighi' (The Pond That Ate People).

It is said that after this, the king became a better person and worked for the welfare of his people. The ruins of his palace can still be found in the village of Manikhar, but Sharaf Khan lives on only in the stories. His descendants did not survive, all claimed by the ancient Purikheko Dighi.
