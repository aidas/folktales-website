Once upon a time, merchants were making great profits through sea trade. In the city of Champai lived a hot-tempered and daring merchant named Chand Soudagar. People also called him Chand Bena. Chand Soudagar was a great devotee of Mahadev, meaning the supreme god Shiva. He cared for no one else but his deity.

Meanwhile, a conflict arose in Kailash between Shiva and the serpent goddess Manasa. Manasa felt immense sorrow. Although her father had granted her the status of a goddess, people on Earth still did not worship her. On the other hand, Mahadev had told her, "You will meet my dear devotee, Chand Soudagar, on Earth."

He had set a condition: only if she could receive worship from him would she be recognized as a goddess in the mortal realm. With that in mind, Manasa prepared herself and set off toward Earth. Her only goal was to make Chand Soudagar worship her, thereby securing her status as a goddess among the people of the mortal world. However, Chand Soudagar was not an easy person to sway. There was no one in the surrounding areas as obstinate as he was.

No matter what, he would not worship Manasa. He had received the "Maha Jnana" mantra from Shiva. With this mantra, whenever Manasa tried to come and seek worship, Chand Soudagar thwarted all her plans. 

One day, using tricks and deceit, Manasa managed to get her hands on that mantra from the merchant. With the protective charm gone, she saw an opportunity. Chand Soudagar had a childhood friend named Dhanwantari, who possessed miraculous powers. With Dhanwantari's help, Chand was saved on this journey, but Dhanwantari was ultimately destroyed in Manasa's wrath.

Returning home, a storm erupted in the sea. Chand Soudagar's ship, the "Shaptadinga Madhukar," was swept away by the waves. He lost all his wealth and riches, and all his companions were gone. With only his life left, he wandered the roads as a beggar. Yet, Chand's stubbornness remained; he would never worship Manasa. He was a great devotee of Shiva! How could he worship another? After much penance, he succeeded in pleasing Shiva once again and received blessings from him.

With the blessings of Mahadev, Chand gradually began to regain everything he had lost. Happiness returned to his household. Chand and his wife, Sonka, welcomed their seventh son, Lakhindar, into their lives. He had already lost six sons, and now only this little boy remained. At the same time, in the affluent family of his friend Soya Ben in Ujaninagar, a beautiful baby girl was born. She was named Behula. From a young age, Behula and Lakhindar laughed and played together, fostering a deep bond of love and friendship between their families.

As they both grew older, it was decided that Behula would marry Chand Soadagar's only surviving son, Lakhindar. In Hindu tradition, horoscopes are matched before a wedding, and this was no exception for Behula and Lakhindar's union. However, fate had other plans! The results of their horoscopes revealed an unprecedented outcome that no one had ever seen before.

The fortune-tellers determined that on the wedding night, the young Lakhindar would be bitten by a snake, leading to his death. However, there was no mention of widowhood in Behula's fate. After much deliberation, everyone decided that going ahead with the wedding was the best course of action. Besides, both the groom and bride were devoted followers of the goddess Manasa, and perhaps she would show her mercy.

But the goddess's wrath was too powerful, affecting the heavens, earth, and even the netherworld. The wedding night of Behula and Lakhindar finally arrived. Chandra Soadagar devised another plan to thwart the goddess. He had a skilled craftsman build an iron wedding chamber for his son and daughter-in-law, ensuring that there would be no gaps or openings for a snake to enter. After all, if a snake was to bite, where would it come from?

However, it didn't take long for the goddess to learn of Soadagar's conspiracy. She appeared in the dreams of the very craftsman who was tasked with building the chamber. The goddess warned him, threateningly, to leave a small gap in the iron chamber, just enough for a thread to pass through. The craftsman thought to himself, "What difference could a mere thread make?" So, he decided to heed the goddess's words, ensuring he kept her instructions in mind while also following Soadagar's wishes.

The craftsman, trying to keep both parties satisfied while also saving his own life, completed the iron chamber as instructed. It was a formidable structure, with cold iron surrounding the newlyweds in the center. Meanwhile, the goddess Manasa, in the form of a serpent, entered the chamber through the thread-like gap. Silently and swiftly, she struck the sleeping Lakhindar, and with that, he lost his life.

When Behula woke up in the morning, she found her husband Lakhindar lying dead beside her. Devastated and determined, she knew that in their village, people would float the body on a banana tree raft after a snakebite. They did the same with Lakhindar, but Behula was resolute; she insisted on accompanying him. Not only that, but she vowed to journey to the heavenly realms to retrieve her husband's soul.

With Lakhindar's body beside her, Behula embarked on a long journey of six months. Throughout the trek, she faced numerous obstacles and challenges, yet nothing could deter her. Driven by her oath to save her husband, she remained steadfast and committed, ready to confront whatever lay ahead.

After six long months, Behula's raft finally arrived at Nita's ghat. Many people affectionately called her "Ma Nito." By chance, she was the foster mother of Goddess Mansa. Seeing the devoted and virtuous Behula in such dire straits due to her foster daughter's curse filled Ma Nito with compassion. 

She said to Behula, "Come with me. I will take you to the court of Indra. There, you will surely find a way to bring your husband back to life." With renewed hope, Behula followed Ma Nito, ready to face whatever challenges awaited her in the heavenly realm.

In the meantime, Lakhindar's body had started to decay. With the help of Ma Nito, Behula reached the heavenly realm, the court of Indra, carrying her husband's deteriorating body. Once there, she performed a dance so mesmerizing that everyone present was captivated. How could they not be? In her previous life, Behula was a celestial dancer known as Usha, and Lakhindar was the heavenly dancer Aniruddha. 

This divine couple had been sent to Earth by Ma Mansa to collect offerings in her honor. Understanding the divine play is a great burden!

In this life, even the goddess Manasa had to yield to Behula's steadfast courage and love. She agreed to restore the lives of Chand Saodagar's six deceased sons and Lakhindar on one condition: that Mahajedi Chand Saodagar would worship Manasa.

However, Saodagar would break, but he wouldn't bend. After all, Manasa had caused him much harm. How could he easily forget? So, although he agreed to the terms of worship, he offered it with his left hand. Despite feeling anger in her heart, the goddess showed no lack of compassion and forgave Saodagar. With that left-handed worship, she returned to the heavenly realm. From that time, Manasa became not only the goddess of heaven but also the goddess of the earthly realm of death.

Even now, in Chattogram, there exists the pond of Chand Sawdagar, and in Bogura, there lie the ruins of the cursed bridal chamber of Behula and Lakhindar. Though the history of the Puranas has grown old, people still remember the tale of Behula's love for her husband and Chand Sawdagar's stubbornness in a new tune. It narrates the enduring struggle of the Bengali woman, embodied in the story of a woman adrift in a boat.
