In a village, there lived a Brahmin and a Kayastha. Their houses were next to each other, and they shared a deep friendship. The Brahmin’s household was in a state of constant struggle, living hand to mouth. The Kayastha’s household did not suffer as much from a lack of basic necessities like rice and lentils, but his situation was not much better either. Neither of them was married.

One day, the Brahmin friend said, “How long can we go on like this? I’m thinking of getting married. But who would marry their daughter to me if things don’t improve? Will this poverty ever end?” The Kayastha friend echoed his thoughts, saying, “Exactly what I keep thinking. No one in this village will give their daughter to us! We'll have to come up with another plan, you see. Let's go to another village and see if we can manage something there." At first, the Brahmin was reluctant, but eventually, he agreed to his friend's suggestion. The Kayastha said, "You don’t have to think too much. Just do as I say."

Following the almanac, the two friends set out on an auspicious day, heading to a distant village in search of brides. After walking all day and growing tired, they finally arrived at a new settlement. While resting under a banyan tree by a large pond, they saw several girls coming to fetch water. Among them, one girl particularly caught the Brahmin's eye.

The Kayastha friend, upon hearing about the Brahmin's interest, went to a nearby shop to gather information. The shopkeeper was a notorious chatterbox; if you asked one question, he'd tell you ten stories. But this habit proved useful as the shopkeeper, while veering off-topic, inadvertently provided some key details. From him, the Kayastha learned that:

“The girl is the daughter of Ramesh Chakraborty. A truly unfortunate soul, my dear. Her groom married her and left, never to be seen again. Not even her family has laid eyes on the groom since the wedding. I've heard he's settled elsewhere in Raniganj with another family. That’s why I say, the poor girl has a lot of bad luck!”

The Kayastha friend, being quite shrewd, thought of gathering more information from the shopkeeper.

“So, can we find out anything about this groom? We're planning to pass through Raniganj anyway, might as well inquire a bit.”

“Oh, my dear, I could tell right away that you gentlemen are well-bred. The son-in-law of Chakraborty's daughter is named Ramlochan Mukherjee. I've heard he works as a clerk in a big boss’s office.”

Listening to all this information and after taking a puff from the shopkeeper's hookah, the two friends set off for the Chakraborti house. The Kayastha friend, with his sly intelligence, planned for the Brahmin to pose as Ramlochan, the groom, while he would act as his servant. They quickly concocted a convincing story to explain why the groom had been away for so long.

“Hey, Mr. Chakraborti, are you home?”

“Who’s there, brothers?”

“Oh my, it’s your son-in-law! Don’t tell me you don’t recognize him!”

The supposed son-in-law was treated with great care and affection at the girl's house. However, the bride herself became suspicious and couldn't fully trust them. Still, she remained quiet, holding back her doubts out of respect for her parents, but she couldn't stop her tears from flowing. Meanwhile, after enjoying the hospitality at their fake in-laws' house for several days, the two friends began considering returning home.

A palanquin arrived outside, accompanied by four bearers. They took the bride in the palanquin, and halfway through the journey, the Kayastha friend said, "You must find a bride for me first. Only then will you start your married life. Remember, you need to get me a wife as good as yours." From behind the palanquin's curtain, the Brahmin's bride heard everything. Her suspicions became even stronger, realizing that neither of the two men had revealed their true identities.

The two friends devised a plan and sent the palanquin bearers back with the empty palanquin. Then, the Brahmin took his new bride home. Seeing the new bride, the Brahmin's mother, and the entire neighborhood were filled with joy and celebration. The fact that the stolen bride accepted them so easily made the two friends completely relaxed and elated, enjoying the moment to the fullest.

But the bride had her own plans. A few days later, as everyone was showering her with praises, calling her well-behaved and capable, the Kayastha friend arrived and said, “Now let’s go find my bride.” The Brahmin immediately agreed, as he had promised his friend to help find a bride, and he was also finding it difficult to spend quality time with his own new wife due to this promise. Without consulting any almanac, the Brahmin handed over all household responsibilities to his bride and set off, saying, “So be it, let’s go!”

Meanwhile, as soon as the two friends left, the Brahmin's wife gathered all the valuables from the house and the money received as wedding gifts, wrapped them in her sari, and set the house on fire. The old Brahmin's mother perished in the flames, and the bride didn’t even look back.

Meanwhile, the two friends returned to their village, only to find that there was no trace of the house or the new Brahmin's wife. Seeing the disaster, the Kayasth friend, shaking his head, said:

“I will not resort to such deceitful paths again.

Otherwise, my own house might turn to ashes too!”

And the villagers, lamenting, said, “Oh, what a beautiful bride and a good mother-in-law—both have gone to heaven!” But in reality, they had not gone to heaven. The bride had fled to her parental home. Even there, she did not reveal the truth. She concocted a story that her mother-in-law had died, so her groom had not come along. She stayed there for a few days, and her parents, being gullible, believed everything she said.

Meanwhile, after performing his mother’s shraddh, the Brahmin decided to visit his bride’s parental home. Oh, when he went there, he saw a different scene altogether. His bride was happily roaming around. Fortunately, she hadn’t disclosed anything to her parents. The Brahmin thought he would try his luck once more and see if fortune might change.

The bride was no less cunning. Having once tricked the Brahmin, she now planned to exact an even harsher punishment on his son. She had procured datura poison from the village witch and planned to mix it into a bowl of milk to poison him as soon as the Brahmin returned home.

As planned, the bride mixed the poison into the bowl of milk. That night, the Brahmin returned to his false wife, hoping to somehow win her back. Having not eaten all day and exhausted from the journey, he was ravenous. Seeing the bowl of milk, he drank it eagerly in one gulp. Shortly after, the poison took effect, and the Brahmin's body turned blue as he succumbed to the deadly toxin.

The Brahmin's wife, having disguised herself in a vibrant red silk sari, wrapped the body in old sarees and made her way to the jungle's edge, where the cremation ground was. However, as soon as she ventured into the forest with the corpse, a fierce storm began to brew. Lightning flashed intermittently, and the sound of crickets intensified. The dark clouds in the sky roared, and the bride found herself trapped in the cremation ground amidst the chaotic storm.

The band of robbers, seeing the Brahmin's wife amidst the dim light of the stormy night beside the cremation ground, thought they were witnessing the goddess Kali herself. They all joined their hands in reverence and vowed to offer golden tongues in her honor. The Brahmin's wife, bewildered and desperate, could hardly comprehend the situation unfolding around her.

Taking advantage of the situation, she looked at the leader of the robbers and said, “I am pleased with you. Here, receive your reward!” Saying this, she threw the bundle containing her husband’s corpse, disguised as Kali, towards them.

Afterwards, the bride swiftly fled on the wind and returned to her father's house. When her family inquired about her husband, she replied that he had gone abroad in search of work and had told her to stay here.

From then on, no one ever troubled the Brahmin's daughter again. Even the real groom, Ramlochan, was never heard from. As for the Brahmin's friend, the Kaysht, he still occasionally searches for his Brahmin friend, wondering what might become of him if he mistakenly ends up at the Chokkottibari.
