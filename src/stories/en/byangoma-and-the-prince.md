King Bhimsen's capital was situated in the western part of Villri. The king was just and fair. Many knowledgeable scholars and Brahmins would visit his court. In that kingdom, there were people of all professions—shepherds, gardeners, oil pressers, blacksmiths, farmers, and even wanderers. Except for the very poor, everyone had homes, and people were generally well-off.

In such a prosperous kingdom lived a young bird hunter. Although he hunted birds, he never killed them. Every morning, he would go to the forest with his net to catch birds. He would capture the wild birds, place them in the net, and carry them to the market. Whatever he earned from selling them was enough for him to eat and live.

He would catch various birds from the wetlands, including the swan and the teal. He captured river eagles, kingfishers, black-necked storks, and even owls from the hollows of trees. He caught parakeets, red-throated finches, and flocks of sparrows. Occasionally, his net would even trap hornbills, along with other birds like waterfowl and cormorants.

One morning, as usual, the hunter set out with his net and cage. At that very moment, the holy Sufi Fakir in Mecca was asked about the state of worship. The Fakir replied,

“O seeker, there is a hunter who goes to the forest every day to catch birds. You should meet him and guide him to the Bengma bird. The prayers from that bird's mouth will spread your devotion across the world.”

As per the Fakir's advice, the holy Sufi disguised himself as a Brahmin, donned a sacred thread and a white dhoti, wore wooden sandals, and carried an umbrella in one hand and a calendar in the other. He stood right in the middle of the hunter's path and said, "Come, hunter, listen to the calendar."

The hunter replied, "Forgive me. I don’t have a penny to spare. I cannot listen to the calendar right now."

Satyapir did not stop. He began reading the almanac:

"Today is Wednesday, the third day of the solar eclipse, which is auspicious for trade. O young hunter, today you will find success in the Sundarbans. You will catch many wild birds in the forest. But listen carefully to what I say: Deep in the forest, in a crack of an Ashoka tree, lives a pair of Bengma and Bengmi birds. If you can catch these birds, all your troubles will be resolved."

Hearing this, the hunter ventured deep into the forest and spread his net near the Ashoka tree.

He covered his body with branches and grass to avoid detection, but he could not escape the keen eyes of the Bengma and Bengmi. The female Bengmi said, “Listen, the forest seems to be moving—an ominous sign. There shouldn't be so many leaves, no flowers, and the branches are swaying strangely. We have been in this forest for a long time, but it seems we need to move to another place. Let's go to a different forest right away. The trees seem to be closing in on us. I've never seen anything like this before. If we stay here, we might lose our lives!”

The male Bengma went to his mate, but he did not give much heed to her words. By then, thanks to the pious intervention, the hunter’s net had wrapped around the Bengma’s neck. The bird struggled on the ground, appearing as if it might die.

The Bengma said, “Hunter, why are you committing this cruelty? The same fate awaits you that you impose on these birds. Every animal or bird you kill or capture will eventually result in your own suffering. Your wife and children will not escape this punishment. Listen to me—worship Lord Krishna.”

Hearing the bird speak in human voice, the hunter cut the net and gently placed the Bengma on his shoulder, stroking its back. Meanwhile, the Bengmi perched on the tree, weeping. She said, “Hunter, you do not understand righteousness or unrighteousness. What you are doing—hunting these birds—is wrong and sinful. At least now, do the right thing: release my husband, and I will give you a small token of reward.”

The hunter asked, “Beautiful, kind bird, I will listen to you. But what will I gain from this?”

The Bengma then began to narrate the story of Krishna to the hunter.

"One morning, Krishna was playing with his friends at his foster father Nanda's house. Amidst the play, little Gopal took some earth in his hand and put it in his mouth. Another boy, witnessing this, ran to inform Yashoda. She rushed over, scolding Krishna in anger, 'Didn't I just give you milk and butter this morning? Why are you eating dirt?' Innocent Krishna replied, 'Stop, stop. I didn't eat any dirt, Mother. Look into my mouth and see for yourself.' When Yashoda looked inside his mouth, she saw the entire universe."

Hearing Krishna's story, the hunter began to cry, reflecting on his sins. He said, "From today, you are my teacher. By sharing Krishna's story, you have purified me. But I catch birds because it's my livelihood. Otherwise, what will I eat? What will I wear?"

Then Bengama gave the hunter three precious rubies strung around its neck. However, the poor hunter, unaware of the value of gems, said, "Did you just give me some wild fruit seeds?"

Bengama then told the hunter, “Take these to the royal court tomorrow. I promise, if you ever find yourself in trouble, just remember me. Bengamas always keep their word.” With this assurance, the hunter released Bengama and headed back home, discarding his hunting net along the way.

Meanwhile, the hunter’s wife was sitting at home, deeply worried. It had been seven days since they had any food in the house. Her husband had gone to the forest early in the morning, and if he had caught any animals or birds, he would surely have returned quickly. Just then, the hunter entered the house empty-handed. Seeing this, the hunter's wife burst into tears. The hunter comforted her and showed her the three rubies that Bengama had given him.

The wife examined the stones closely and said, “Are these really rubies? No, they must be some kind of fruit seeds.” Saying this, she tossed them aside. Two of the rubies fell inside the house, but one rolled outside. That night, they spent in frustration and sadness. When they both fell asleep, a guard was patrolling outside. He noticed the ruby gleaming in the moonlight and picked it up. Without wasting any time, he took the ruby and hurried back to his own house.

Satya Narayan knew everything that had happened. He sat by the sleeping hunter’s head and appeared in his dream, saying, “Wake up, wake up. How can you foolishly throw away the rubies out of anger? The bird gave you priceless gems. Why are you sleeping after discarding them? Take the remaining two rubies to the king! Your days of suffering will end.”

In the morning, the hunter took the rubies and went to the royal court. He pleaded with the king, “Please give me some rice and some coins, and I will return to my cottage.” The king laughed in disbelief, “How many maunds of rice do you want in exchange for these?”

The hunter, not understanding much about such matters, asked for five maunds of rice. The king, knowing the true value of the rubies, easily gave him the five maunds of rice. The hunter and his wife were overjoyed.

That night, after dinner, the king sat on his bed and chewed on some betel leaves mixed with camphor. He then gifted the two rubies to the queen. The queen was overjoyed. She called her maids and instructed them to adorn her. They combed her hair, tied flowers into her bun, and applied kohl to her eyes. The queen looked stunning, like one of Indra's celestial nymphs. But one of her maids commented, “If there were one more piece of jewelry, your look would be complete.”

The maid said, "Tell the king to get another ruby. If the queen wears it on her forehead, her beauty will shine even brighter than a hundred moons."

When the king returned to the inner palace, the queen mentioned this to him. However, the king no longer had any more rubies. The queen began to cry and insisted that the king must somehow get another ruby for her.

To calm the queen, the king then summoned his ministers and asked for their advice. They suggested that they should bring the hunter and ask him to find another ruby. The king's messenger went and brought the hunter to the palace.

Hearing this, the poor hunter felt as if the sky had fallen on his head. Nonetheless, with hope in his heart, he said, “Very well, Your Majesty, I will go back to the place where I found the previous ones and get another.” He was then released.

The hunter returned to the forest and went to the same Ashoka tree. However, this time, as soon as the Bengma saw him, it flew away. The hunter sat at the base of the tree and began to weep, calling out, “You promised me. Please keep your promise, Bengma!”

Then the Bengma descended and the hunter took it to the royal court.

“Your Majesty, this bird is the one that gave me the jewels.”

“Can you give me another jewel right now?” the Maharaja asked.

“Your Majesty, I have no wealth other than the name and stories of Krishna,” replied the Bengma.

“Then let us hear about Krishna from your lips!”

Everyone listened in rapt attention as the Bengma described the birth of Krishna, the roles of Brahma and Narayana, and the story of the Govardhan Hill. Impressed by the Bengma’s account, the Maharaja decided to abandon the path of envy and embrace devotion. The Maharaja was very pleased with the Bengma’s advice and released the hunter. However, the Maharaja did not release the Bengma. He placed the Bengma in a golden cage, and both the king and queen made it a ritual to hear Krishna's stories from the Bengma twice a day.

Twelve years passed in this manner. One day, a horde of tigers attacked the kingdom. The Maharaja, leading an army of ninety thousand soldiers, set out to drive away the threat. Meanwhile, Prince Kamodara, captivated by the stories of Krishna from the Bengma, was enchanted.

The Bengma said, "Kamodara, I will now dance for you. Enjoy the performance." As the Bengma began to dance, spreading its feathers like a magnificent peacock, the prince was spellbound. The Bengma then said, "But dancing inside this cage is impossible. Release me, and I will show you my true performance."

Kamodara said, “But you will just fly away.”

The Bengma replied, “Why would I fly away? If you release me, I will be able to show you my dance properly.”

Not realizing the Bengma’s trick, Kamodara opened the cage. The Bengma flew out and danced for a while, spreading its wings. As the prince became distracted, the Bengma took off, laughing, and flew up to the top of the palace walls. Kamodara was left in despair, as if the sky had fallen on his head.

The Bengma, as it flew away, reassured Kamodara, “If the king tries to harm you, remember my words, and I will come to your aid. But after being imprisoned for twelve years, I cannot stay here any longer.”

With that, the Bengma flew away. At that very moment, the king returned from the forest and sent for the Bengma. Upon hearing that the bird had escaped, the king was furious. Kamodara was summoned immediately, and he knew there was no escape from the king’s wrath.

The bird had flown away, leaving the unfortunate prince in dire trouble. Kamodara, in tears, begged his father for mercy. However, the king showed no compassion, as the loss of the bird seemed to him a greater grievance than his son's plight. By the king's orders, the guards dragged Kamodara away. At this moment, Kamodara pleaded with the guards:

“Please, let me go to my mother just once. She can surely persuade my father to show mercy.”

Kamodara pleaded with his mother, but she harshly replied, “Why did you let the bird go? My words hold no weight against the king’s orders.” Heartbroken by his parents’ lack of compassion, Kamodara had no choice but to face his fate. The guards, following the king’s orders, took him to the forest.

Desperate to save his life, Kamodara made one last plea. He asked the guards to allow him to bathe in a nearby lake and pray to Krishna for his salvation before his death. The guard, being kinder than the king and queen, agreed to this request.

Kamodara, while bathing and performing the ritual with a few drops of Ganga water, remembered his parents, friends, and finally Bengma. His prayers reached the divine, and the Supreme Being, aware of Bengma’s promise being forgotten and the imminent danger to Kamodara, became displeased.

Saty Narayan, seeing the situation, scolded Bengma: “You fled and left Kamodara in peril. Now, because of you, Kamodara is about to be executed. I command you to go immediately and bring him back here on your back.”

Bengma immediately flew and carried Kamodara to safety. Upon seeing this, there was a wave of despair among the people. However, the king and queen remained indifferent as before. The citizens of the city began to weep bitterly for the prince.

Meanwhile, Bengma carried Kamodara high into the sky, seemingly approaching the heavens. Then, heading west, he flew deep into the forest. Upon reaching a dilapidated house, Bengma gently set Kamodara down and said, “Stay here until I return with food. Do not leave this place until then.”

Bengma replied reassuringly, “I won’t leave you in danger. I will return, so don’t worry. Just wait here, and stay safe.”

The bird reassured Kamodara and flew off in search of food. Nearby was another kingdom ruled by King Birbar. The bird entered the capital and, from a sweet shop, obtained some confectionery. On its way back, while flying over the royal palace, the bird saw the princess. Named Suryamoni, she was as beautiful as the sunrise. The bird thought to itself, “How can I arrange a marriage between this beautiful girl and Kamodara?”

After Kamodara had his fill, the bird told him about Suryamoni. Upon hearing this, Kamodara became restless. However, the palace was surrounded by magical barriers. How could they get inside?

After much thought, the bird devised a plan. Using its magical powers, it bypassed the enchantments and brought Kamodara right into the princess’s chamber.

Kamodara did not touch the sleeping Suryamoni, fearing that he might wake her. Instead, he simply admired her beauty before returning that night.

Two days later, Kamodara again mounted the back of the bird and visited the princess's chamber. A lamp adorned with precious gems was burning by Suryamoni’s pillow. Once again, Kamodara did not wake her but spent the entire night admiring her beauty. He thought, "If I leave now, how will the princess ever know that Kamodara visited?" So, he draped his own cloak over the sleeping princess.

When Suryamoni awoke in the morning, she was astonished to find the blue cloak draped over her.

The next morning, the palace staff weighed the princess as was customary. To their surprise, her weight was double the usual amount. The attendants were astonished, but Suryamoni explained, “It is normal for a growing young woman’s weight to increase. You may go now.”

As night fell and Kamodara returned, he found the princess awake. Seeing him, Suryamoni became very angry. “Who are you? Whose son are you? Where is your land?”

Kamodara then revealed his entire sad story to her. Hearing his plight, Suryamoni's anger softened, and her heart began to melt.

From then on, every night Kamodara would visit the princess, Suryamoni, riding on the back of Bengma. Thanks to the saint's miraculous powers, no one had a hint of what was happening.

One day, Suryamoni became pregnant. The news created a stir in the royal palace, but Suryamoni denied all accusations. The guards were given three days to find out who was visiting the princess.

In disguise as a Vaishnav saint, the guard thoroughly searched the city for two days without success. Finally, that night, the guard sprinkled vermilion powder around the princess's bedroom.

When Kamodara arrived that night, Suryamoni warned him and told him to leave. Kamodara obeyed her. However, as he entered, his clothes got stained with the vermilion. The next morning, Kamodara returned to the depths of the forest and took his stained clothes to a washerman to clean them.

Meanwhile, the clever guard went straight to the washerman's house, where Kamodara's clothes were left near the door. In the evening, when Kamodara came to collect his washed clothes, the guard, disguised as a washerman, seized him.

Furious, the king ordered Kamodara to be executed. Suryamoni was devastated and wept bitterly, pressing her forehead in despair.

After reaching the lake's edge, Kamodara requested some time from the guards, citing the need to pray one last time before his execution. He then descended into the lake and called out to Bengma. The divine bird came to his aid, rescuing him and Suryamoni, and they all fled together.

With Bengma's help, they settled in a small, happy home in the forest. One day, Suryamoni expressed a strong desire to taste a special mango. Kamodara lamented, "I am just an ordinary man. How can I obtain such a fruit?" Hearing this, Bengma assured them, "I promise to bring this mango for you. Do not worry. I will cross seven seas and return from Lanka in twelve days. Stay here and be safe."

Bengma flew to Lanka Island and retrieved the special mangoes. He ate one himself and carried the other two on his return journey. However, during his voyage, he landed on the island of Chandan, and despite his promise, he did not return.

Days turned into weeks, and Suryamoni and Kamodara, desperately searching for any sign of Bengma, eventually reached Chandan Island. There, they discovered Bengma's lifeless body among the sandalwood trees, with the two mangoes he had brought for them lying beside him.

The grieving prince performed a ritual bath for Bengma's body in the Ganges and offered pindadan for Bengma's and his ancestors' souls.

After consuming the fruit Bengma had brought, Suryamoni gave birth to a healthy son after ten months and ten days. They named him Birbar, after Suryamoni's father.

The three of them then boarded a floating banana raft in the river. A Nepali rat, which was actually sent by the pīr, was drifting nearby. Despite Suryamoni's objections, Kamodara insisted on using the rat to carry the raft. The rat, not understanding the divine intervention, gnawed at the raft in such a way that it broke into three pieces, sending them in different directions.

Kamodara drifted to the northern lands and found work in a sugarcane plantation. Suryamoni reached a gardener’s estate and was welcomed into the home of the gardener’s wife. Their son was rescued and taken in by a merchant named Gangadhar, who treated him with great care and affection, much like Krishna was cared for by his foster father Nand.

Thus, five years passed, with the child growing up well under Gangadhar’s loving care.

Suryamoni, working day and night in the gardener’s house, one day saw her son with a beautiful housewife. Overwhelmed with emotion, she could only cry while reciting the name of Rama.

At that moment, the truth-pir appeared before her and told her to go to her child. He also informed her that Kamodara was in the city, staying at a laundress’s house.

Suryamoni then went to her son and revealed everything to him. The boy, filled with many questions, ran to the merchant and asked, “Father, tell me the truth, who are my real parents?”

The merchant realized it was time to tell the truth. With a heavy heart, he recounted the story of finding the boy by the river. The boy then wanted to go to his real mother. Understanding the merchant’s pain, the boy was comforted by hearing the stories of Krishna and Yashoda. Despite the sorrow, the merchant bade his son farewell with a heavy heart.

The boy told his birth mother, Suryamoni, “Let’s go find father now.”

Meanwhile, that morning, Lord Satyanarayana appeared in Kamodra's dream and instructed him to sit under a specific tree with sweets the next morning. He also mentioned that during a festival, Kamodra would be reunited with his wife and child.

At dawn, Kamodra followed the instructions from his dream. Meanwhile, his wife and son were traveling the same path. Eventually, they were reunited. Following Suryamoni’s advice, they set off towards Kamodra’s homeland. On their journey, they passed through the kingdoms of Raja Veerbahu, Krishna Ketu, Vishwajoy, and Veer Mahajeta.

Then preparations for the worship of Satya Pīr began. Learned priests and Brahmins arrived. The worship area was adorned with gold and betel leaves. Large quantities of sugar, flower garlands, milk, jaggery, and sweet bananas were brought in. A ceremonial dish, the *shirni*was prepared. Conch shells were blown, and drums and claps marked the celebration. The Brahmins chanted the Vedas, completing the ritual with great devotion.
