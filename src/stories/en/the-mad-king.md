Around the beginning of the 17th century, an extraordinary person named Sattua Borua ruled over the [Chakma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakma_people) kingdom. He was a skilled yoga practitioner. It is said that he attained such a level of mastery over his own body that he could take out his intestines, wash them, and put them back in their place. He kept these abilities of his a secret. Even when he bathed, he did so behind closed curtains. One day, his wife, the queen, decided to peek behind the curtains out of curiosity. She was so horrified at the sight of the king's intestines out in the open that she let out a deafening scream. Out of fear of being exposed, the king tried to put back his intestines hastily. However, something went wrong in the process, and as a result, the king lost his sanity.

After that incident, the king became an entirely different person. He became extremely irritable and aggressive. He would have men killed at the smallest of excuses. The situation got so bad that the king's royal advisors began plotting an assassination. One day, when the king was being carried to the temple on his palki, his men began to yell, "Run, wild elephants are on the loose!" The king stepped out to have a look. But alas, an assassin was perched on top of his palki. At the right moment, he jumped off and severed the king's head with one clean swipe of his blade. The queen helped cover up the murder by spreading rumors of the king being killed by wild elephants. To avoid drawing further attention, they decided to forego cremation and buried the king's body in secret.

A few days later, the king's daughter, Princess Omolongi, began seeing visions of her deceased father in her dreams. In these visions, the late king foretold the day when he would be reunited with his severed head and rise up to take revenge on the people who plotted his assassination. She shared her visions with the queen, who became quite disturbed. The king was a devoted worshipper of the gods, so it was entirely conceivable that he could miraculously come back to life. After consulting with her ministers, the queen decided not to take any chances. The king's body was dug up, and exactly as the visions foretold, the severed head had joined with the rest of the body. Seeing this, the queen immediately ordered the body to be chopped into seven pieces and spread around the nearby mountains and rivers. It is rumored that one such piece is still buried inside a hill called "Pagala Mura" in the Alikadam Upazilla of Bandarban.
