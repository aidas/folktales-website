Once upon a time, there lived a day-labourer who struggled to make ends meet. All day long, he did various odd-jobs around the village, and when he returned home he busied himself with domestic chores. He never had the time to socialize with people and as the years went by, a sense of lonliness enveloped him. Driven by the desire for companionship, he spent his evenings sculpting a lifelike wooden figure of a beautiful woman. Once finished, he envisioned it as his wife. He would affectionately utter, “Honey, can you hear me?" and even make requests like "Could you please roll me some tobacco?". He'd then proceed to make tobacco for himself. Whenever he finished cooking, he'd ask his wooden creation, "My dear wife, is the food ready?" and proceeded to serve food on his own plate. Somehow, the poor man found a semblance of happiness in this imaginary family.

One day, he made plans to meet up with an old friend. He bid farewell to his wooden wife and asked her to have food ready by the time he returns. Spending the entire day catching up with his friend, he found himself evading questions about his marital status. He was too embarassed to say he was single. So he lied and said he was married. Hearing this, his friend feigned being upset at him for not inviting him to the wedding, and insisted to be introduced to his wife that very day. Seeing no way out of this situation, the poor man agreed to this and prepared for the biggest humiliation of his life.

When the two men approached the house, the laborer was surprised to see clothes hanging out in a line. He thought his neighbor bhabi might have felt pity on him and did his laundry. But as they came closer they could smell the aroma of a deliciously cooked meal. Before the dumbfounded laborer could reach out for the door, a gorgeous woman opened it for him. She looked exactly like his wooden sculpture. Yet, somehow she looked even more beautiful and youthful in skin and flesh.

The three of them had dinner together. The friend felt envious of the laborer's fortune. He couldn't imagine how the old man managed to marry such a young and beautiful woman. He began to devise a malicious plan to fulfill his desires. Before leaving, he proposed a game, "We'll both invite each other over for dinner and whatever we touch within the other person's home, shall become our possession.” The laborer was taken aback at this weird proposal. But seeing nothing of value in his home, and considering that his friend was quite wealthy, he awkwardly agreed to the game.

A few days later, the laborer and his wife visited their friend. After dinner, he laid his hands on his friend's wife's jewellery box. His friend reluctantly gave away the jewellery as per the rules of his own game. When it was the laborer's turn to invite his friend over, his wife pulled him aside and shared with him her suspicions about his friend and asked him to be cautious. Throughout dinner the friend began to repeatedly glance at the laborer's wife. Immediately after finishing her meal, she excused herself and brought a ladder into the room. As soon as she noticed the friend approaching her she climbed the ladder and perched on the wooden beam in the ceiling. The friend was undeterred, and grabbed hold of the ladder to begin climbing. Just then, the laborer came running and said, "Ah my dear friend, you knew I had nothing of value in my house. So you decided to take my cheap ladder to spare me from embarrasment." The friend realized that his plan was foiled and he promptly left the house with the ladder to avoid any further confrontation.

Having outwitted their friend, the laborer and his beautiful wife laughed together for the rest of the night. He was happy to have finally found his soulmate.
