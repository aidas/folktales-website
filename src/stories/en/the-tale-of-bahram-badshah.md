There was once a king named Bahram. Like other kings, he had granaries full of grain, a treasury overflowing with wealth, and a kingdom of subjects. However, unlike many others, this king was not cruel. He had a heart full of kindness and compassion. Whoever stood at his door asking for something, he would grant it without a second thought. This king was a truly generous soul. But this habit of giving brought misfortune upon him. Despite his goodwill toward everyone, his luck began to turn. And the bringer of this ill fate was none other than a beggar who stood at the king’s door one day.

One day, the beggar approached the king and said, "I've heard that you are a great benefactor, that anyone who asks for something receives it. Will my request be granted at the door of this merciful king?"

True to his nature, the king replied, "Ask without fear, whatever it is that you desire. If it is within my power, you shall surely have it, I assure you."

The beggar revealed his desire, and upon hearing it, the courtiers were struck with shock and horror—"Choose one, O King—your kingdom or your faith. Whichever you leave behind shall be this beggar's to claim."

If he gave up his kingdom, the king would have to live a life of hardship in this world. But his faith? That was the greatest treasure for the afterlife. The devout king, with a heavy heart, replied to the beggar, "This world I do not know, but the next, I understand well. Take away my kingdom, it is yours to claim."

With these words, the king handed over all the keys, treasures, and wealth to the beggar and, with his family, set off towards the wilderness. There was no food, no shelter. The grandeur of kingship had vanished, leaving behind only poverty and hunger. The princes grew restless from the gnawing hunger and the exhaustion of the journey. Seeing her children suffer so, the queen could bear it no longer. She took off her golden bangles and set out in search of a merchant who could offer them something in exchange.

With hope in her heart, the queen believed that selling her bangles would at least provide food for her children. But upon reaching the riverbank, she found no merchant in sight. In despair, she sat down by the river and wept. Just then, she saw a ship sailing down the river, laden with a merchant's goods. A glimmer of hope returned to her heart. She approached the ship. Meanwhile, the sight of the beautiful queen stirred wicked thoughts in the mind of the merchant aboard. He devised a plan to deceive her and get her onto the ship. 

When the queen asked for money in exchange for her bangles, the merchant, pretending to buy them, coaxed her onto the ship. As soon as she boarded, the ship set sail. The queen quickly realized the terrible mistake she had made, but by then, there was no way to return.

Meanwhile, the condition of the king and the princes was far from good. As they waited for the queen, a long time passed. Eventually, they set out in search of her, heading in a different direction. They soon arrived at the riverbank, but how were they to cross? Before them lay a small dinghy, too small to carry all three at once. 

The king decided to place his younger son in the boat and crossed the river first with him. He tied his older son to a tree using reeds and vines from the marsh, intending to return for him after safely crossing with the younger one.

But fate had other plans! Wherever the unfortunate king turned, the river seemed to dry up further. His luck was as grim as the circumstances. While attempting to return for his older son after leaving the younger one safely in the boat, the dinghy began to sink. Now, one son was on either bank of the river, while their father struggled in the middle of the water, fighting to stay afloat. Meanwhile, their mother was imprisoned on a wicked merchant's ship!

Thus, two days passed. The king managed to survive, somehow clinging to life, but he had not yet drowned in the river. After finally reaching the bank, thoughts of his children occupied his mind, while his sons were facing their own twisted fates.

The older son had been crying out for help since the moment he was tied to the tree. Unfortunately, a tiger came along and took him away. However, a brave hunter intervened and rescued the prince from the tiger’s grasp. Meanwhile, the younger prince was left alone, weeping in despair, with no one around to hear him. His cries of sorrow caught the attention of a fisherman and his wife, who felt pity for him. 

The older brother was taken to the hunter’s home, while the younger one became the companion of the fisherman. Thus, those destined for royalty found themselves living in the humble abodes of a hunter and a fisherman, their fates having taken a remarkable turn.

Having lost his family, the distraught King Bahram wandered aimlessly, searching for anyone but finding no one. One day, his travels led him to a strange city called Khorram. Recently, the king of this city had passed away, and the queen was in a state of confusion, unsure of what to do next. Seeking guidance, she turned to her vizier.

The vizier suggested, “Release the king’s mad elephant—whoever it encounters will be chosen as the queen’s companion.”

Thus, King Bahram was being sought in the city of Khorram. What a strange twist of fate! At that very moment, a king who had lost everything was wandering outside his kingdom. The mad elephant, wandering around, stopped right in front of the unfortunate king. With its head swaying and trunk waving, it lifted Bahram and placed him upon the royal throne.

He regained a queen, a kingdom, subjects, and riches—all of it—but he had lost his original family. Yet, what magic there is in the throne! It seemed that the king forgot all about his past. He continued to govern his kingdom in happiness, embracing his new life.

Do you remember the two sons of the king? The ones who later became the son of a hunter and the son of a fisherman? They have now grown up. Having completed their studies, they work in the royal palace. However, they do not recognize each other and continue to live as strangers, going about their tasks. Yet, due to their skills and dedication, they have become the most trusted servants of the royal household.

The former king of Khorram had a merchant friend who traded goods by sea, traveling to various lands. After a long absence, he was returning home and thought, “It would be nice to visit my friend!” However, upon arrival, he learned that his friend had passed away many years ago. Nevertheless, the current king was not a bad person. He warmly welcomed the merchant, offering him great hospitality. A grand celebration was organized at the royal palace, complete with music and festivities, creating a lavish gathering.

The merchant hesitated slightly before agreeing to the gathering, saying, “But my new friend, my wife is on the ship! How can I leave her behind…” The new king reassured him, “No worries at all! You need not think about it. I will send my two most trusted servants to keep an eye on your wife right away. You enjoy yourself and have fun.”

At the royal palace, festivities and merriment were in full swing, while the two brothers, unaware of their true identities, went to keep watch over the merchant's wife. Once there, they joined the ship's crew in a lively conversation, sharing tales of joy and sorrow. They recounted stories from their childhood, including the time they lost their parents and the hardships they faced, as well as the encounter with the beggar. The atmosphere was filled with nostalgia, laughter, and a sense of camaraderie as they bonded over their shared experiences.

In this story, the brothers recognized each other and embraced as the two princes of the royal family. Meanwhile, hidden away, the merchant's wife, who was actually their long-lost mother—the queen—listened to everything. The heartfelt reunion of mother and sons took place, and tears of joy filled their eyes. However, just as they were basking in their happiness, the king's guards arrived and seized them. They accused them of a grave offense, questioning their behavior with the merchant's wife. The tension mounted as the royal authority confronted the reunited family, setting the stage for a dramatic turn of events.

Then the two brothers began to share their detailed story with the king. They recounted how the threads of their lives had been torn apart and how their family had become separated due to the whims of fate. With every word they spoke, the king shed more tears. No matter how much he ruled over another kingdom or lived with another queen, he couldn't forget his own wife and children. Memories flooded back to him. Meanwhile, the merchant watched, helplessly aware that in just a short while, he would face execution.
