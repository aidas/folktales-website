The English officers were searching for girls from ordinary homes to take as gifts. It wasn’t just the officers; there were many soldiers and guards who needed to be pleased as well, and the landlord’s lackeys were tasked with this grim job. A young girl, recently married, was supposed to go to her husband’s home, but fate dealt her a cruel hand. Instead, she was being taken in a boat, led astray by the landlord’s men. Their intentions were anything but good. Just as the boat was about to dock at the Kacharibari ghat, out of nowhere, a boat with twenty-two oars appeared. With a fierce strike of spears, the landlord's boat was shattered into pieces.

"What happened? What happened?"

Everyone was utterly shocked, even the unfortunate girl. Then, a figure emerged from the shadows—a bandit. Most had never seen him before, but everyone knew his name. The bandit reassured the girl, saying, "Don't be afraid, sister. Get on my boat." The boat then sped away with the swiftness of an arrow, bringing the girl safely back to her father. With a raised hand, the father blessed the bandit, saying, "People will remember you for generations to come."

It was the late 19th century, a time of great turmoil across the country. The masses were awakening, driven by movements and revolts, shaking the balance between rulers and the oppressed. In the midst of this unrest, a Robin Hood figure emerged in the village of Nalka in Pabna. He was indeed the Robin Hood of the Chalan Beel. Taking from the rich and giving to the poor, no other name would suit him better. But he had a name of his own—Mahar Khan.

People say that Mahar Khan wasn't alone—he was rumored to be accompanied by a band of ghosts and spirits. How else could he appear out of nowhere, striking like a phantom in the night?

Maher Khan had no family left, and the ruthless zamindar's tyranny had stripped him of his ancestral home, which was eventually auctioned off. With nowhere else to turn, Maher sought solace by becoming a disciple of a Sufi saint. He spent several days with the saint, but the unrest in his heart never subsided.

All around him, he saw the rich exploiting and oppressing the poor, and it pained him deeply. Maher felt a strong urge to do something, to stand against injustice and help those who were suffering. This inner turmoil and sense of responsibility began to shape his path.

But the situation was far from straightforward. Maher decided that the only way to aid the poor was by taking wealth from the rich. He confided his plans to the Sufi saint, who warned him to avoid causing harm to innocent people, no matter what. With the saint's blessing, Maher Khan embarked on his mission.

"I've lost so much already, so I no longer fear losing anything else. But I swear, I will never take away the bread from an orphan or a poor person. Whatever wealth I acquire through my raids, I will distribute it all to the poor. And I'll regularly offer offerings at the shrine of the Sufi saint."

Mahar first joined a group of stick fighters. To resist, one must first become capable. So, he spent many days learning how to wield a stick and received training in various weapons. As Mahar became quite skilled, one day he encountered a cruel and oppressive landlord.

The landlord was making his way along the river with his entourage, accompanied by music and dancing courtesans. Suddenly, a boat with twenty-two oars swiftly approached and launched a surprise attack. The loud cries of the bandits shouting "Harere re re!" echoed, abruptly silencing the music, dance, and festivities. The landlord's guards were thrown straight into the water, leaving the entire group in chaos and fear.

The bandits demanded nothing of gold or wealth; they only wanted the landlord. He was dragged out alone, and without a moment's hesitation, a club struck his head. In an instant, the landlord sank into the water, never to rise again. This marked the beginning, and from that moment on, Mohar Khan's relentless campaign never stopped.

Not just this one landlord, but all the tyrannical landlords in the region began to fear Mohar Khan. Boats laden with riches were looted, tax collections were seized from the land offices, and Mohar Khan would distribute the wealth among the poor. If he deemed that a landlord's sins had reached their limit, this fearless bandit would not hesitate to take their life.

Mohar's anger toward the landlords never waned, as it was their cruelty that had destroyed his own life. He spent the rest of his days as a protector of the poor, fighting against the very landlords who had wronged him. In return, he earned a life on the run, a fugitive with no place to call home.

Mohar Khan's robust physique was a testament to his rigorous training, which made him more formidable with each passing day. His eyes burned with a fierce intensity, so much so that anyone who found themselves under his piercing gaze would be instantly struck with fear and bewilderment.

Mahar Khan had made the landlords lose their sleep. Fearing him, the landlords’ men often searched for him, forcing Mahar to adopt various disguises. Once, while crossing the river in the guise of a regular traveler, Mahar spotted a poor Brahmin on the boat.

The Brahmin wiped his tears and spoke to the boatman, "You know, boatman, I went to ask for help from my patrons to arrange my daughter's marriage, but I got almost nothing. What will happen now, only God knows!"

Mahar Khan, who was on the boat with his trusted companion Nasu, started chatting with the Brahmin. In the course of their conversation, the Brahmin mentioned the tale of Mahar Khan. The two listened and laughed, amused by the irony of the situation.

After the boat reached the shore, Mahar Khan called the Brahmin over and said, "Don't worry about your daughter's marriage. Here, take five hundred rupees. And on the day of the wedding, everything else you need will arrive in pots of curd."

As the day of the Brahmin's daughter's wedding approached, the father grew increasingly anxious. From the morning, he was restless, worrying whether trusting the words of an unknown man would doom his daughter's fate. But Mahar Khan, the notorious Dakat, was a man of his word. Despite his reputation for leading daring raids and striking fear into the hearts of landlords, he had a code of honor that he never broke.

Even though he had heard those stories, the Brahmin's hair stood on end with fear. As he worried and contemplated, he saw that the milkmen had arrived with the curd. They set aside three pots separately. One of the milkmen said, "Here, take all the money. Make sure your daughter has a good wedding."

As the milkman was about to leave, he paused, turned back, and asked, "Master, may I see your daughter? I once had a sister too, but I lost her to cholera." The Brahmin, moved by the words, replied, "You saved my honor. At least have a sweet. What’s your name, my son?" The bandit, disguised as a milkman, answered, "My name is Mohar Dakat, the name that makes people in this region tremble with fear. Farewell, Master." The Brahmin had never experienced such a miraculous event in his life. Such was the mysterious and fascinating character of Mohar Khan, the Robin Hood of Bengal.

"At the fear of Mohar Khan, life departs from the body."

But Mohar Khan never intended to scare ordinary people, nor did he want to. His anger was directed at the oppressors—those who exploited and cheated people, trampling over them just for money. His true aim was to punish those who committed such injustices.

Wherever Mohar Khan went and whatever he did, he never forgot his Saint's mantra. That’s why he had the power to become invisible whenever he wished. During British rule, there were numerous attempts to capture Mohar, and he frequently eluded the police. On one occasion, he was being taken away with his hands and feet shackled by a stern officer, but Mohar managed to devise a way to trick their eyes and escape.

Mohar Khan told the police, "Just hold onto my shackles for a moment; I want to take a proper bath before going to jail." Saying this, he submerged into the river and became invisible. After that, he was never seen again for a long time.

Ten days of the bandit and one day of the police. In the end, Mohar was caught. According to the law, the list of crimes under Mohar's name was not small. For extortion of taxes, banditry, attacks on landlords, and murder—cases were filed against Mohar at the Pubna District Court. But it was rare to see such a flood of people for a criminal. Everyone, except for the police, the judge, and the landlords, seemed to wish for Mohar's release. However, that was not to be. As punishment, Mohar Khan was sentenced to life imprisonment in exile. After that, there were no further reports on when he left the world behind.

Perhaps Mohar Khan spent his remaining days alone on that island, settling his accounts, or maybe he vanished using the powers of his Sufi Saint. The story of this bandit is shrouded in mystery and enigma, leaving behind a legacy wrapped in intrigue.
