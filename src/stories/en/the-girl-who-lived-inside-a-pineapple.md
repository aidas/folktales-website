In the city of Bairat, there was a prince named Emran. One night, he dreamed of a girl of unmatched beauty. Since then, he lost all desire for food and sleep—the melody of her presence played endlessly in his mind. But finding this girl was no easy task, for she did not reside in any ordinary palace. She lived far away, within a pineapple. Inside the core of the pineapple was a vast palace, and the girl was surrounded by fourteen layers of curtains.

Anwar Kali, the maiden with hair so long it trails upon the ground, captivates everyone who sees her—they fall to the earth in awe. Yet, no one can approach her, for each layer of curtain surrounding her is guarded differently. Breaking through these walls of protection to reach Anwar Kali is nearly impossible.

People say that even animals, birds, or a single gust of wind cannot enter that dark palace. And it’s not just the maiden herself—her maids, each as beautiful as heavenly houris, guard her every step.

Their anklets chime with gold threads so fine,

Each maid like an angel, guarding in fourfold lines.

Four paths, five maids,

Each radiant, as if no earthly beauty could compare.

Thinking day and night of that strange maiden in the mysterious palace, Emran eventually left everything behind—his home, his land—and wandered aimlessly, lost in her thoughts. Moving like a madman, he traveled from country to country, until one day, his steps took him to the kingdom of Eran, ruled by King Bhanu Udas. Bhanu Udas had a daughter, a princess of great renown.

The princess’s gaze fell upon Emran, and she was immediately taken by him. Little did anyone know, this princess had never married; she spent her days secluded in her chambers, practicing magic and spells. She was so captivated by Emran that she cast a spell by the riverbank, trapping him within a _kadam_ flower in her hair bun. Thus, a few days passed in this enchanted state.

The princess would gently sway the _kadam_ flower, laughing joyfully as she did. Over by the river’s stone-paved bank, a clever crow named Dhal Kauwa would often fly about. Noticing the princess’s unusual laughter, Dhal Kauwa sensed that something was amiss! So, one day, he swooped down and deftly snatched the enchanted _kadam_ flower from the princess's hair.

Losing Emran, the princess became frantic with sorrow. She pleaded with the king, her father, saying he must somehow catch that crow. King Bhanu Udas loved his daughter dearly, treasuring her like no other. Seeing his beloved daughter so distressed, he sent messengers throughout the kingdom with a royal proclamation:

"From the king, a stern decree,

Hear ye all, from far and near—

A command to slay the crow,

The king has given, loud and clear!"

The proclamation echoed far and wide: anyone failing to kill the crow would be impaled. The entire kingdom trembled in fear, and people rushed out in search of the crow.

Even the sharp-eared crow, Dhal Kauwa, heard the warning beat of the messenger’s drum. Ever since, he had been flying non-stop, carrying the enchanted kadam flower with him.

No rest in sight, for wherever he went, people awaited him with weapons raised. Some threw stones, others swung brooms, trying to hit him. But Dhal Kauwa stayed just out of reach, flying high above them all. Furious with frustration, the king ordered his entire kingdom impaled—no one was spared.

The crow continued his flight, gliding over the land of terror-stricken people, still carrying the enchanted kadam flower. In that moment, the king's senses returned, and he lamented:

"Oh dear, what madness have I wrought

In search of a single crow!

This kingdom, now devoid of subjects,

How can I remain here alone?"

Seeing the princess, the king became even more enraged. He couldn't comprehend why his daughter was so distressed over a mere crow:

"Why, my daughter, have you wandered

To that riverbank over there?

What madness possesses you,

That a single crow drives you to despair?"

As the king tried to pull at the princess's hair, she ran out of the palace. She could no longer stay in that palace. At that moment, she encountered the fugitive crow. Seeing the crow, tears welled up in the princess's eyes; her beloved Shah Emran was right there! The crow felt a twinge of pity.

The crow spread its wings and offered shelter to the princess. Even when the king came searching, the crow did not reveal any information about the princess. Riding on the back of the crow, the princess escaped the land.

"Fearing death, the princess

Climbed onto the crow's back.

With the wind, the crow

Soared away."

For six years, the crow flew on, carrying the enchanted princess on its back. After six years, they arrived at the land of the pineapple. There, the crow said to the princess, “The heart of the one you love, Emiron, belongs to another. He loves the beautiful Anwar Koli Kanya, who lives inside the pineapple. If you take him to her, your Emiron will be happy." Upon hearing this, the princess's heart shattered.

But she agreed. The crow then guided her to the entrance of the pineapple palace,

"Seven thousand maidens keep watch over her inside.

The princess resides within the pineapple,

Dressed beautifully in finery,

So you mustn't sleep or lay down,

Among the maidens who stand guard!"

Thus adorned, the princess wrapped herself in raw golden silk and wore jingling anklets on her feet to become the handmaiden of the pineapple princess. The clever crow gave her a special potion that, when sprinkled, would put all the guards to sleep.

After seven days of sleep, when they awoke, they found that all the curtains had been cut away, and the pineapple palace was completely free! No one knew that the princess of Eran had come to this palace with the help of the clever crow. Before leaving, she had entrusted her beloved Emran to the pineapple princess.

They were both happy together, but seeing Emran with the princess, the general thought, "This must be the real culprit!" Without listening to any further words, he killed Emran right then and there. Emran's lifeless body lay on the floor of the pineapple palace.

In hand was a gun,

With bullets loaded,

He aimed and shot,

And Emran fell dead.

After Emran's death, the princess of the pineapple was stunned. She couldn't comprehend what had just happened. This beautiful prince had brought joy into her dark life, and now he was gone! Overwhelmed by sorrow, she tore a piece from her saree and sat down to write a letter. Whispering into the wind, she said, "Deliver this to the wise crow."

She had written ten lines in the letter, but what a cruel twist of fate! Only one line reached the crow: the news that Emran was no more. Alas, no one knew who the wise crow truly was. In reality, the wise crow was also the daughter of a general, named Zarina.

Zarina had been living in Emran's kingdom all along. She had liked Emran since childhood but could never express it. When the princess of Eran had trapped him with her magic in a kadam flower, she had taken the form of a crow to rescue him! Upon receiving the letter, Zarina fell to the ground and vowed:

"Oh, pineapple princess,

What have you awakened in me?

I will tear apart your fourteen petals

With the power of my feet."

After that, the magical daughter Zarina would sometimes take the form of a crow and sometimes the form of a snake, racing back and forth to the land of the pineapple. Finally, in the guise of a human, she tied the pineapple in her sari and fled. Then, one by one, she unleashed fire arrows and burned the pineapple palace to ashes.

Before burning down the entire country, she went into the captain's house and rescued the pineapple girl with her left hand. There, she found Emran's body sprawled on the floor. She carefully tied him up in her sari and took him to the enchanted garden. There was a magical spring named Ab Hayat, whose water could revive the dead when sprinkled on them.

As the water of Ab Hayat was sprinkled,

By God's command,

Shah Emran rose and sat up.

Then, taking on the form of the shield crow, Zarina flew into the sky with the pineapple girl and Emran on her back.

Meanwhile, tied in the hem of her garment was the pineapple palace. After flying for six months, they finally reached their own kingdom. There, she shed her form of the crow.

Emran recognized her as the daughter of the general!

Zarina, golden sand,

Her name became known as Yaar.

Seeing Zarina, Emran realized everything—the pain in Zarina's heart. But his mind was still painted with the image of that pineapple maiden. "Where is Zarina, where is my pineapple princess?"

Then Zarina revealed everything to him: "I've loved you since childhood. But the day you left your home in search of the pineapple maiden, I looked into the fate and saw that your destiny was tied to hers. So, I went to find her for you. The pain in my heart is too much to describe. Just keep me as your servant, and my life will be complete."

Hearing all this, Emran's heart softened. He immediately called for a kazi and married Zarina. Then, he went to the garden and cut open the pineapple to release the pineapple maiden.

From that day forward, Emran became the king of the land, with Queen Pineapple Maiden by his side, and the clever crow, now in the form of Zarina, served as a maid in the palace. But is there always a happy ending for everyone in stories?
