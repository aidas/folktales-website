Once upon a time, long ago, there lived a king in a certain land. Like most kings and nobles, his treasury was overflowing with wealth. In the elephant stable, the elephants trumpeted joyfully, and in the horse stable, the horses sharpened their hooves. He had plenty of people and soldiers. Yet, there was one sorrow in the king's heart—he had no children. What use is such wealth and prosperity if there is no heir to carry on the family legacy? The king spent his days in deep sorrow.

One day, in his deep sorrow, the king decided to end his life in the dense forest. It was midnight. Seeing the distressed king, Shiva and Parvati appeared before him. After listening to all of the king's woes, Shiva granted him a boon, promising that a beautiful child would soon be born to him. Filled with joy, the king returned to his palace. Shiva's boon came to fruition quickly, and a beautiful daughter was born in the royal palace—her name was Maloncho.

Maloncho grew up happily, and there was no lack of anything in her life. To share in her joy, she had Madhob, the son of the chief minister, as her companion. They ate together, studied together, and played together. Thus, twelve happy years passed, and their childhood friendship blossomed into love. However, the question nagged at Madhob: would the son of a minister be able to unite with the king's daughter? One day, he decided to confront her, saying that Maloncho must promise to marry him; otherwise, they could no longer be together.

“The swan lives in water,  

The parrot resides in the tree.  

What Madhob says is true,  

Maloncho, I will marry you, indeed.”

But no one else was aware of the secret feelings between the princess and the minister's son. Therefore, the king decided to arrange Malonchos marriage to another prince. When they heard this, it felt like a thunderbolt struck the hearts of the lovebirds. They had promised each other! After some thought, they resolved to run away together. Maloncho asked Madhob to bring a boat made of pawan wood, oars made of hiramun wood, and a steering made of mon mon wood. Madhob immediately set out to find these materials.

But three long months passed, and Madhob could not find the hiramun wood, nor the pawan wood, nor the mon mon wood. In his despair, he lay down under a tree in the forest. Suddenly, he heard voices coming from among the branches. It was a magical parrot and mynah, conversing about him! Curious, Madhob leaned in to listen closely to what they were saying.

Parrot:  

“Who is this again? Where did he come from?  

Indeed, he has come, but why is he sitting here?”  

Moyna:  

“This is Madhob, here for wood,  

Without the wood, the marriage will be completely off!  

Then Maloncho will go to the prince’s home,  

And the prince will give her golden and diamond sarees.”  

Parrot:   

“Oh! What wood do you need? What wood do you seek?  

Is there none here in this place?”  

Moyna:    

“Stay in the forest, do you not know the woods?”  

“Whose boat has been here all this time?”  

—“No one’s.”  

“Whose is it now?”  

—“Yours.”  

“If it is mine, then take it to Malonchos palace right away.”  

As soon as the words were spoken, the enchanted boat flew swiftly, taking Madhob to Malonchos home, where the wedding festivities were already underway. Maloncho was busy with Shiva's worship, and through her singing, she conveyed to Madhob to wait for her in the boat. Meanwhile, before Shiva, the princess requested a boon that everyone in the kingdom should fall unconscious until she could escape with Madhob. Shiva listened to the devotee's plea once again, and according to Malonchos wishes, the task was accomplished. However, unbeknownst to both Madhob and Maloncho, another danger was lurking nearby.

In the kingdom, there lived a treacherous thief known for his terrifying nature, who offered young maidens as sacrifices. He had set his sights on Maloncho and was now hiding in the enchanted boat, disguised as Madhob. When Maloncho reached the boat, she realized the deception, but it was too late. The treacherous thief took Maloncho to his home, where he shattered the magical boat to prevent Madhob and Maloncho from reuniting. Later, as he went to the blacksmith's house to forge a new sword, Maloncho heard eerie laughter coming from the well beside the house. With trepidation, she approached the well to investigate.

“Who laughs in the well?”  

“We are the souls of a hundred maidens, victims of the treacherous thief.”  

The spirits of the hundred maidens informed Maloncho that if she could somehow kill the treacherous thief and pour even a drop of his blood into the well, they would all come back to life. They also revealed to her that if she headed east of the house, she would find a fairy-like horse. The solution to her problem lay with that horse. Determined, Maloncho devised a plan to confront the treacherous thief.

After a while, the thief returned home and asked Maloncho to pay homage to his deity. Maloncho replied, “I am the king’s daughter—I cannot bow down. Teach me how.” Just as the thief leaned in to teach her how to bow, Maloncho seized the opportunity and struck him with the sword, decapitating him in one swift blow. She then took a drop of his blood and poured it into the center of the well, where the souls of the hundred maidens had mourned. In an instant, all of them came back to life.

Maloncho used a rope to pull each of them up one by one, providing them with food and clothing to restore their strength. After ensuring they were well taken care of, she sent them back to their respective homes. Thus, under the brave hand of the princess, one hundred maidens were freed, and the terrifying treacherous thief met his end.

So much had transpired, yet Madhob remained oblivious to it all. How could he know? Under Shiva's blessing, everyone in the kingdom had fallen unconscious, and Madhob was among them. As soon as Maloncho left the kingdom, he regained his senses. Looking around, he noticed that the wedding festivities were still ongoing. But alas, where was Maloncho? He searched inside and outside the palace and across the entire kingdom, but he could not find her anywhere.

Having saved the lives of a hundred maidens, Maloncho rode the fairy-like horse and galloped away from the thief's house, losing all sense of direction. It felt like she was embarking on an adventure to explore the world. Eventually, she arrived in the land of a mysterious king. There, she bid farewell to the horse and sat beneath a tree, waiting. Before long, the king himself came to meet her. However, Maloncho was not in her feminine form; she had disguised herself as a man for convenience during her journey. Yet, even in disguise, could the radiance of her beauty truly be hidden?

The king offered Maloncho a job, and she agreed. However, she had one peculiar condition: she requested a house surrounded by a high fence where she could live alone, and not even a bird should enter without her permission. The king accepted her terms without hesitation.

Maloncho lived in the house, working for the king while often reminiscing about Madhob. Meanwhile, Madhob faced his own hardships as he searched for Maloncho, traveling from one kingdom to another. One day, fate led him to Malonchos kingdom, but their reunion wasn't going to be easy. In this realm resided a wicked sorceress who enchanted any prince she desired, turning them into sheep to use at her whims.

Upon seeing Madhob, the sorceress was immediately drawn to him. Using her cunning tricks, she cast a spell on him, transforming him into a sheep by day while allowing him to retain his human form at night. Thus, Madhob's days became a struggle between his animal existence and the fleeting moments of his true self under the moonlight.

In the royal palace, Malonchos days were not bad. One day, she caught the attention of the princess. The princess was enchanted by Maloncho's masculine appearance. However, Maloncho did not realize this; her thoughts kept wandering back to Madhob.

One day, a royal court was convened, and everyone was present— the princess, Maloncho, and the minister. During this time, news arrived that a terrifying demon was wreaking havoc in the kingdom. No one could defeat it, as it was taking whoever it wanted from their homes. The king declared, "Whoever slays the demon shall have the princess as their reward." However, no one was able to succeed in this task, and people were disappearing in groups at the hands of the demon.

Then the king called Maloncho aside and told her about the demon, requesting that she must kill it, no matter how. No sooner said than done. Maloncho mounted her magical horse and flew faster than the wind—soaring through the skies. She reached the jungle where the demon resided. Upon arrival, she saw the demon, who, after devouring thousands of people, was resting comfortably, taking a nap.

Maloncho had a gun with her. She thought, "This is the perfect moment." Without even setting foot on the ground, she fired her gun from the sky. The bullet hit the demon straight in the head. The demon fell right there, utterly defeated! With no one around to help him, the demon had no chance to fight back. His death was certain. Maloncho then cut off the demon’s head and brought it back to show the king.

The king was overjoyed upon receiving the demon's head. He declared the reward: "The one who slays the demon shall marry the princess!" Maloncho was thunderstruck. How could this be possible? But defying the king’s decree would cost her life. So, Maloncho agreed with a condition:

"Your Majesty, in our country, the marriage ceremony first takes place with the sword. Only after six months is the groom wedded. If you agree to this custom, then I am fully on board."

The king was very fond of Maloncho, so he agreed to this condition as well. But six months is not a long time. One by one, the six months passed, and Maloncho still couldn't find Madhob. With no other choice, she brought the princess home. That night, a sharp sword was placed between them, and Maloncho said to the princess, "Move even a little, and your life will be at risk!" The princess behaved accordingly.

One night, Maloncho had a dream where she was told to sacrifice a hundred rams and dig a pond. Upon waking, she went to the king and said, “We must dig a pond—bring a hundred rams.” The king sent messengers with drums and trumpets throughout the kingdom, declaring that by any means necessary, they must gather a hundred rams! 

Coincidentally, those hundred magical rams belonged to the same wicked sorceress, who had once enchanted Madhob. However, by this time, the sorceress was no longer alive.

As the preparations for the sacrifice continued, Maloncho noticed that the hundred rams needed to be bathed in the pond before the ritual. Among them, one ram stood out—it was strikingly beautiful, with silver horns that gleamed in the light. Maloncho was particularly drawn to this ram and felt an inexplicable connection. She decided to set it aside while the remaining ninety-nine rams were led into the pond.

When the sorceress had turned the princes into rams, she had placed a magical branch on their heads to keep them under the spell. As the rams were bathed in the pond, each one’s magical branch fell off, and the princes regained their human form. Witnessing this, Maloncho grew suspicious. She turned to the princess and said, “Let’s take this special ram to the palace and give it a proper bath.” The princess, already enamored by the beauty of the ram, agreed readily.

Once in the palace, as soon as they bathed the ram, the magical branch fell from its head, and there stood a handsome young man—none other than Maloncho's long-lost Madhob. Seeing his striking appearance, the princess also found herself smitten. Maloncho, however, couldn’t help but smile quietly to herself, knowing the truth.

Since Maloncho was disguised as a man, Madhob initially did not recognize him. Allowing Madhob to rest, Maloncho went into the inner palace. She shed her male form and donned a beautiful saree, then slowly approached Madhob. Before that, she explained everything to the princess, who surprisingly didn’t mind, as she had already fallen for Madhob.

Maloncho said, “Just as you are a princess, I am too. May Madhob be yours as well as mine.” With that, Maloncho took both Madhob and the princess to the king and revealed the whole story. In a grand celebration, the weddings of both princesses to Madhob took place, uniting Madhob and Maloncho as well. Thus, they all lived happily and peacefully together.
