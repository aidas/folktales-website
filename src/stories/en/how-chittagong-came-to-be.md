In ancient times, most of the present-day region of Chittagong was covered in dense forests. Apart from a few nomadic tribes there weren't any large human settlements in the area. This presented a golden opportunity for Sufi preachers who were looking for new areas to settle. One particular Sufi saint named Hazrat Badar Shah was fascinated with this prospect and wanted to explore the banks of the Karnaphuli river. His followers warned him of the rumors of deadly creatures of both natural and supernatural origins that lurked in the area. But Badr Shah was undeterred. He stepped on a large stone and using his mystical powers, commanded it to float in the water and take him on a voyage through the river.

As the daylight began to fade and darkness engulfed the forest, Badr Shah started to suspect that he was being followed. But being a man of faith, he remained assured that the Almighty would never lead him to harm. He decided to stop for the night and climbed up a hill to set up his camp. In the middle of the night, a group of men wearing white robes stormed in to his tent, abducted him, and took him to their leader. Except, these were no ordinary men, they were from the local tribe of Jinns. And their leader was none other than the Jinn Badshah himself.

"Who are you?", exclaimed the king of the Jinns. "Your Majesty, I am Badr Shah of Arabia and I have come to settle in these lands." The king became furious at this audacious response. "Silence, this forest is the dominion of Jinns. Humans are not welcome here." Seeing the king's fury, the saint backed off and said, "I apologize for trespassing. Would you be kind enough to provide me a place to sleep for the night? I have traveled a long way and I would appreciate a little bit of mercy." The Jinn Badshah wanted to further humiliate his prisoner. He said, "Fine, I will allow you to stay for one night. But you may only occupy as much space as is illuminated by a single lamp." Badr Shah abided and walked to the edge of the cliff, took out a clay lamp from his bag and set it alight. At that moment, a bright light illuminated the entire mountain. The light rays were so powerful that it melted off the skin of the Jinn and burned off the wings of the Poris. Not being able to tolerate the divine light, the entire tribe of Jinn immediately vacated the area and left the forest in haste. It is said that the light of Badr Shah's lamp could be seen from dozens of kilometers away. Out of curiosity, a group of people approached the hills and upon hearing about the departure of the Jinn, they found the courage to establish the first village in the area.

The locals used the word "Chati" (চাটি) to refer to a clay lamp. Therefore the first village came to be known as Chatigram (চাটিগ্রাম). Over time, this name evolved to its current form "Chottogram" (চট্টগ্রাম).
