Many years ago, in the village of Kella Tajpur in Mymensingh, lived a Mughal nobleman named Omar Khan. He had a daughter named Sakhina. Unlike other girls of her age, Sakhina didn’t play with dolls. Instead, she had the desire to become a warrior, and she received ample training to fulfill that dream.

In the history of Bengal, the Baro-Bhuiyans were a group of landlords who rebelled against the Mughal Empire to defend the independence of their regions. Among them, the most famous was Isa Khan. He was entrusted with the responsibility of Jangalbari.

Dewan Firoz Khan was the successor of Isa Khan. He governed a vast area in Kishoreganj, located about four miles from Jangalbari. After the death of Isa Khan, Firoz Khan sought to continue his grandfather’s struggle against the Mughals. The atmosphere was tense, with the constant threat of conflict looming over them every day.

Firoz Khan's mother, Amma Begum, was not particularly supportive of his constant involvement in battles. Having witnessed a lifetime of war, she yearned for peace in her later years. One day, she summoned the vizier and expressed her concern: "Vizier Sahib, I am deeply worried about Firoz. If we could arrange his marriage, perhaps he would focus more on his home and less on the endless pursuit of freedom outside. Maybe he will find happiness within the confines of his own household."

And so began the search for a bride for Firoz. Proposals started pouring in from various zamindar families, accompanied by gifts. Firoz Khan was presented with numerous portraits of potential brides, but none of them captured his interest. Then, suddenly, his eyes fell on a picture that had been set aside.

His attention was immediately drawn to the portrait of a young woman, riding a black horse, her eyes blazing as she held up a sword. Firoz couldn’t tear his gaze away. This was exactly what he had been looking for—not just the gentleness of a woman, but the spirit of rebellion that she embodied.

The fiery spirit of rebellion shone brightly in this young woman—perhaps she could be the perfect companion for the freedom-loving Firoz. He bought the portrait from the matchmaker at a high price and then hung it beside his grandfather’s picture, encased in a gleaming golden frame on the wall.

The daring girl in the portrait was none other than Sakhina Bibi, the warrior daughter of Kella Tajpur. Hours would pass as Firoz gazed at the image of Sakhina, sword raised high, her fierce expression captivating him. Days went by like this, and before he even realized it, Firoz found himself deeply in love with Sakhina.

After spending so much time with the portrait, Firoz Khan felt it was time to meet the real person. With this thought in mind, he disguised himself as a fakir and arrived at Kella Tajpur. At that time, Sakhina's father, Omar Khan, was not in good health. Under the guise of a fakir, Firoz's sweet words and attentive care helped Omar Khan recover significantly.

However, despite spending so much time in the palace, Firoz never got a chance to meet Sakhina. Ironically, just when he was about to leave with a heavy heart, fate intervened. On that very day, he encountered Sakhina at the pond's edge in the fort. Their eyes met, and a silent conversation took place between them, a conversation known to no one else. Firoz simply said, “At the pond's edge, with my own tears, I leave my heart’s message for you, Sakhina.”

Sakhina’s father, Omar Khan, was aligned with the Mughal side, while Firoz's entire lineage had fought for independence throughout their lives. From the very beginning, there was a fundamental problem. Upon learning Firoz’s true identity, Omar Khan flatly rejected the relationship.

Firoz's mother sent a marriage proposal, but Omar Khan rejected it. With no other options, Firoz decided to attack Killa Tajpur, rescue Sakhina, and then both of them fled and married. They settled in Jangalbari.

Upon learning of the marriage, Omar Khan declared war against Jangalbari. After a significant battle along the banks of the Narsunda River, Firoz was captured. However, his soldiers continued to fight as much as they could.

Meanwhile, Sakina eagerly awaited Firoz. Her heart was confident that her husband would emerge victorious in the battle. Thus, she sprinkled fragrant rosewater along the path, preparing a variety of sweets and delicacies to be distributed among the villagers.

But where was Firoz? Dressed in a red sari, Sakina looked like a bride anew. At that moment, news arrived from the battlefield: Firoz Khan had been captured. Upon hearing this, the new bride Sakina Bibi immediately transformed into a warrior. She donned her battle gear once more and prepared to lead the troops in Firoz Khan's absence.

No matter what, the fight had to continue. Sakina Bibi, mounted on a white horse, charged out of the Jangalbari fort with determination. Fearlessly, she led her troops into battle. Seeing Sakina on the battlefield reinvigorated the despondent soldiers with new hope. They surged from the Narsunda River to the Shuriya River, turning the waters red with blood. Crossing this river would bring them to Sakina's father's home, where her beloved Firoz was being held captive.

Sakina, ready to drive out all enemies and head to the fort, was suddenly met with a white flag from the opposing side—a sign of peace. Did Omar Khan surrender? As hope began to rise, a messenger arrived with the news: “There is no need for further fighting, Sakina Bibi.” “Firoz Khan has given you a divorce.” Sakina saw the divorce decree, signed by Firoz himself. The bloodshed along the banks of the Shuria River, the struggle for freedom—had it all been for nothing? Was this the betrayal she faced?

Sakina fell slowly from the horse’s back, the commander’s attire slipping from her shoulders. Betrayed, she felt as though a venomous snake had struck her forehead. Thus, Sakina's name vanished from the world. However, in the village of Kumrigram, where she met her end, there still stands a shrine in her memory—Sakina Bibi's mausoleum.

Did Firuz really divorce her? Or was it all a cunning ploy by Sakina's father? Perhaps he did not realize that his scheme would lead to the loss of his own daughter's life. At the shrine built in Sakina's name, it is said that a dervish would often come in the evening, lighting a lamp and shedding tears on Sakina's grave. Though no one knew, it can be inferred that this dervish was none other than the devoted Firuz Khan.
