In the year 1315, amidst the bustling town of Jhalokati, there dwelled a young lad by the name of Abdul Ali. At just twenty years old, he possessed a striking handsomeness that caught the eye of many. Abdul had a penchant for adventure, and so he often found himself traversing the countryside on horseback, exploring every nook and cranny.

One fateful day, his journey led him to the town of Barisal, where he stumbled upon a troupe of snake charmers. Among them stood a young maiden named Nibaran, whose beauty rivaled that of the morning sun. Instantly captivated by her charm, Ali found himself falling head over heels in love.

However, the daunting task of confessing his affection to Nibaran's father weighed heavily on Ali's mind. What if the old man refused to give his daughter's hand to a stranger? Such thoughts plagued Ali's every waking moment, until he devised a cunning plan.

Under the cloak of darkness, Ali liberated all the serpents from their cage, concealing them away from the snake charmers' sight. When dawn broke and the charmers set out to perform in the village, they were mortified to discover their empty cage. Suspicion fell upon the foreigner in their midst â€“ who else would dare such audacity?

As tensions rose and accusations flew, Ali emerged from the shadows, ready to face the consequences of his actions. Yet, to his surprise, the eldest of the snake charmers intervened, urging restraint. "Let us not harm the foreigner," he counselled, "for he is our guest, and it is not our way to raise hands against our guests."

With this declaration, the mood softened, and the charmers turned their attention to Ali. They welcomed him with open arms, tending to his needs and seeking answers regarding the whereabouts of their snakes.

Ali spoke, "I am a foreigner who has come here, yet none of you have bothered to inquire about me. Therefore, I am upset with you and have hidden all your snakes." The snake charmers, in response, pleaded, "Return our snakes, and in exchange, we shall grant you whatever you desire." Seizing the moment, Ali expressed his wishes before everyone.

The snake charmers readily agreed to Ali's proposal. Amidst great festivities, Nibaran wedded Ali. Following their marriage, Ali and Nibaran went to their own home. Ali's mother welcomed her daughter-in-law with immense joy, and the following months passed by happily.

However, one fateful night, Nibaran had a haunting dream about a colossal python. The serpent demanded a goat be sacrificed for the well-being of her husband. Providing an address, the snake warned that if the sacrifice wasn't made, danger would loom. Trembling with fear after the vision, Nibaran recounted her nightmare to Ali. Yet, Ali, unperturbed, became enraged and resolved to eliminate the snake. Hearing Ali's decision, his mother began to lament and urged him not to proceed. However, Ali disregarded his mother's pleas.

On the 8th of Magh, 1315, Ali assembled seventeen boats and meticulously prepared for his expedition to confront the python. Docking the boats near the serpent's dwelling, Ali left everyone aboard and ventured alone toward the snake's mound. He arrived at the mound and commenced playing the flute. Enchanted by the melody, the snake emerged from its dwelling, hissing menacingly.

In the blink of an eye, the one-foot-long snake swelled into a 45-foot beast, wrapping its body around Ali. Feeling trapped, Ali desperately called out for his mother and wife. Fortunately, a passerby named Tamizuddin noticed blood on the ground and glanced up at the bamboo trees, where he spotted the massive snake constricting a man. Swiftly, he rushed to a nearby boat and shouted, "One of your men has been ensnared by a snake!" Ali's mother, upon hearing the news, began to wail in distress.

Meanwhile, Nibaran was fast asleep. Despite Abdul Ali's mother's lamentations not stirring her, Nibaran's own mother grew furious and began kicking her. After three forceful kicks, Nibaran finally awakened and offered two goats as sacrifice before the serpent. However, the snake remained unappeased. Fearing for Ali's life, Nibaran hurled an enchanted shell at the snake's head. Upon impact, the snake released Ali and reverted to its original size.

Carrying Ali's lifeless body, Nibaran rushed to the Amtali police station. The constable, upon inquiry, attributed Ali's death to a snakebite. However, driven by greed, the constable twisted his words, accusing Nibaran of murdering her husband and blaming the snake. Faced with no other choice, Nibaran bribed the constable with ten rupees, prompting him to list Ali's demise as a result of a snake attack.

After settling matters at the police station, Nibaran brought Ali's body home, where mourners gathered around him. Undeterred, Nibaran began reciting mantras using the shell left by her father. As her chants grew in intensity, the snake, stirred from its unconscious state, became increasingly agitated. Unable to withstand the fervor of the incantations, the serpent sucked the poison from Ali's body and perished.

To everyone's amazement, Ali gradually regained consciousness. In gratitude, blessings poured forth for Nibaran. As her husband recovered, Nibaran ceased her recitations and humbly embraced him. Ali's mother rejoiced with overwhelming happiness. Moved by the ordeal, Ali vowed never to act impulsively again without full understanding.

From that day forth, Ali lived harmoniously with his wife Nibaran and his mother, embracing a life of happiness and understanding.
