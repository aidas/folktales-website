In the heart of a dense forest, nestled within the Garo Hills, lived a notorious bandit leader named Humra Dakaat. His life was one of lawlessness and plunder, marked by the fear he instilled in the hearts of villagers. One fateful night, while raiding the home of a wealthy Brahmin, Humra's gaze fell upon a six-month-old girl, her beauty as radiant as the moon. This innocent child stirred a change within him, awakening a long-dormant emotion: love. Unable to leave her behind, Humra took the child and raised her as his own. Years passed, and the stolen child, named Mahua Sundari for her breathtaking beauty, blossomed into a young woman. Humra, now a [snake charmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede_people), showered her with affection, teaching her the secrets of his trade. Their bond transcended the boundaries of their unconventional family, woven together by love and mutual respect.

Dewan Nader Chand, the son of the [zamindar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamindar) of Bamankanda village, sat lost in thought under the starry sky. He was supposed to be leading a meeting, but his mind was far away, captivated by a rumor he had heard: a group of snake charmers had arrived in the area, and among them was a girl of unparalleled beauty. Consumed by curiosity, Nader Chand abruptly ended the meeting and sought permission from his mother to host the snake charmers at their palace. He knew that, as the zamindar's son, he could easily arrange such entertainment, for their lavish home often played host to grand dances, songs, and diverse events. His mother readily agreed, and soon Humra and his troupe arrived at the palace. As Mahua, the beautiful young woman Nader Chand had heard so much about, began her mesmerizing snake charming performance, his heart knew no bounds. He was smitten, utterly captivated by her grace and captivating presence.

From that moment on, Nader Chand could only think of Mahua. He yearned for her presence, his love for her blooming with each passing day. Finally, unable to bear the silence any longer, he confronted her, confessing his fervent love. To his immense joy, Mahua, drawn to his passion and charm, revealed her own affection for him Nader Chand, a nobleman, and Mahua, the daughter of a snake charmer, belonged to different worlds. Yet, their love refused to be bound by societal norms. They met in secret, their stolen glances and whispered words fueling their passion.

One midnight under the moonlit sky of [Chaitra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choitro), Nader Chand awoke with his beloved Mahua on his mind. He reached for his cherished flute and began to play, his melody carrying through the night air like a love song. Mahua, hearing the familiar notes, instantly recognized Nader Chand's call. Like a moth drawn to a flame, she dashed out of the house, her heart pounding with anticipation. Reaching the riverbank, she found Nader Chand sitting there, his flute serenading the night. Their eyes met, and a spark ignited. They embraced, their bodies clinging to each other as if they were one. In a passionate whisper, Mahua confessed her love: "I want to leave everything behind and run away with you. I am madly in love with you, and every moment without you is an eternity." Their embrace, however, was witnessed by Humra, who watched from a distance. Fear and apprehension gripped him as he realized the depth of their connection. He knew their love would face insurmountable challenges due to their unequal social status. To prevent further complications, Humra took a drastic step. Under the cloak of darkness, he fled the village with Mahua and his team, leaving Nader Chand heartbroken and alone.

Nader Chand, his heart shattered into a million pieces, felt the pull of madness tugging at his soul. He fabricated a story about going on a pilgrimage, but his true destination was Mahua. He searched for her tirelessly for three months, his eyes scouring every face he passed, asking if they had seen a girl of her breathtaking beauty. Finally, as the first signs of winter painted the month of [Agrahayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogrohayon), Nader Chand found Mahua on the banks of the river Kansa. It was as if life had flooded back into her veins the moment she laid eyes on him. With a joyous heart, she fetched water from the river, cooked a delicious meal, and served it to him with her own hands. Humra, however, was consumed by worry upon learning of Nader Chand's arrival. One night, he roused Mahua from her sleep and spoke with a heavy heart, "For sixteen years, I have raised you alone, enduring countless hardships. You have always followed my word without question. But now, a stranger has come to threaten our happiness, and I cannot tolerate it." With these heavy words, Humra placed a dagger in Mahua's trembling hand and uttered a chilling command, "While Nader Chand sleeps, plunge this dagger into his chest and end his life." But Mahua's love for Nader Chand burned brighter than any fear her father could instill. She could not bring herself to kill the man who held her heart. Instead, under the cloak of night, they crossed the river in a small boat and sought refuge in the depths of the forest.

Six months had passed, and Nader Chand and Mahua had built a haven of happiness within the embrace of the forest. However, complacency often follows joy, and their idyllic life was shattered when Humra and his band of snake charmers appeared in their sanctuary. Humra handed Mahua a poisoned knife, its purpose weighing heavily in her hand. But her love for Nader Chand burned brighter than any fear or obligation. With a heart brimming with love and sorrow, she plunged the blade into her own chest, finding solace in death rather than betraying her love. Nader Chand, witnessing his beloved's selfless sacrifice, was overcome by grief. Unable to bear the thought of a world without her, he took the same blade and followed her into the embrace of the afterlife. In that moment, their souls intertwined, forever united beyond the veil of life.
