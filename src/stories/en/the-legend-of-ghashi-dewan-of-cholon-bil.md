About 500 years ago, Shah Makhdum (RA) journeyed from the distant lands of Arabia, through Yemen, to finally settle in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Accompanying him was Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA). Shah Makhdum (RA) was a revered Islamic saint who, along with numerous disciples, came to this region to spread the teachings of Islam. Among his followers, some dedicated themselves to spreading Islam, while others devoted their lives to serving humanity. Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) was one of the most notable among them.

He devoted himself to serving humanity in the sacred land of Chalan Beel, which is renowned as the land of the Baro Auliya (twelve saints). His arrival in this region was guided by divine inspiration and the instructions of Shah Makhdum Baba. Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) traveled from Rajshahi, passing through Natore, and eventually arrived in Singra, a thana within the Natore subdivision. From there, he wandered until he reached a small piece of land between Satpukuria Hijli and Dahiya.

To determine the nature of the crop, Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) put a single sesame seed into his mouth. Immediately, a divine message was revealed to him: "O great man, whose crop have you eaten without permission?" Troubled by this, Baba began searching for the owner of the land. He eventually discovered that the owner was Kali Pada Ghosh from the Dahiya area. Baba, feeling remorseful, hurried to Ghosh's home and asked for forgiveness for eating just one sesame seed. In return, he expressed his willingness to work for the Ghosh family for 12 years as a way of atonement.

Ghosh quickly realized that Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) was no ordinary person and agreed to employ him according to the proposed terms. Baba was assigned the task of cutting grass at Ghosh Mahashay's household. Kali Pada Ghosh was involved in the curd business and owned many milk-producing cows. Every day, Baba would take a boat, go out to cut grass, and then return to the Ghosh household with the boat fully loaded with grass.

Many people saw Baba Ghasi Dewan (RA) sleeping on the boat, with his head at one end and his feet at the other. Such was his miraculous power, which later led to him being known as "Ghasi Dewan." However, there is little information about his real name. After working for 12 years without any wages at the Ghosh household, Baba bid farewell to Kali Pada Ghosh and set out once again on a journey to the unknown.

In the heart of Chalan Beel, near the spot where Baba Ghasi Dewan's (RA) shrine is located, there used to be a dangerous whirlpool. Anyone who fell into it was doomed, with no chance of escape. One day, as Baba was passing by this perilous place, he noticed a dead cow floating in the water. He stopped his boat and began eating the raw meat from the carcass. Coincidentally, two young boys were sitting on a nearby jungle-covered mound, witnessing this strange event.

One of the boys was the son of a fisherman, and the other was the son of a barber. Seeing Baba Ghasi Dewan eating the raw meat, they were both puzzled. When they spoke to Baba, he offered them the meat as well, and without hesitation, they ate it. Baba Ghasi Dewan, with his miraculous powers, could make the impossible seem possible, performing such extraordinary acts with ease.

From that moment on, the two boys became devoted followers of Baba Ghasi Dewan. Even today, their graves are located beside Baba's at the shrine. Baba Ghasi Dewan made that dense, jungle-covered mound his dwelling, and over time, it gained popularity. People from various places began visiting just to catch a glimpse of him.

The place in the heart of Chalan Beel remains highly popular even today. Thousands of people visit the shrine, hoping for their various wishes and desires to be fulfilled.
