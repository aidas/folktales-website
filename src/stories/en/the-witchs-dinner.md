That was long ago. At the edge of a small village lived a shepherd boy and his mother. They barely managed to get by, tending to their cows and sheep. One day, the shepherd boy had a strong craving for some pitha (traditional rice cakes). But when he went to his mother and expressed his wish, she snapped at him, "We barely have enough to eat every day, and you want pitha? Making pitha requires so many things! Where will we get them, where will we find them?" Hearing this, the boy quickly replied, "Write down a list of what you need. I'll go and get everything. Then you can make pitha for me." And so, no sooner said than done. His mother handed him the shopping list and said:

"For the pitha, bring some sugar,

Make sure the grains are superfine.

For the pitha, bring some milk,

So fresh that no one’s had a sip.

For the pitha, we need rice flour,

But don't bring any rice bran, not even a trace!"

But the young shepherd didn't have a single coin, so how would he bring all those things? Even though he had no money, the shepherd boy was clever and full of ideas. So, he started thinking of another plan.

He marched the herd straight into the paddy field. Instead of grass, the cows feasted on the paddy stalks. After letting the cows devour a significant portion of the crop, the shepherd boy returned home with them. Afterward, the boy began to beat the cows hard, forcing them to regurgitate the food they had eaten. He then collected the regurgitated food, and his mother cleaned it thoroughly. She sorted the rice, dried it, and then pounded it to make rice flour.

Now, milk was needed. But the cows weren't his own, so he couldn't just milk them—he’d get scolded by the owner if he tried. So, the shepherd boy came up with another clever idea. He went to a spot on the road that led up the hill in the village, and there, he poured a lot of water to make the ground muddy. So that anyone passing by would slip and fall. The shepherd was quite the mischievous one. Everything fell into place perfectly. When the village milkman was passing by with his milk, he slipped into the muddy trap the shepherd had prepared. The milk container shattered into pieces.

Meanwhile, the shepherd, sneaking past the milkman, filled his own milk container. Singing “Taire Naire Na” (a traditional song), he went home and handed the milk to his mother, then used the same cunning to procure sugar. His mother was very pleased. She thought her son had become quite resourceful, gathering all the ingredients beautifully. Now, she was ready to make the best pitha ever.

The shepherd ate all the pithas by himself, leaving just one large piece. After resting for a while, he dug a hole in a good spot in the field and buried the piece of pitha. Within a few days, a sprout emerged from the buried pitha, growing into a huge pitha tree. On each branch of the tree, hot pithas hung like mangoes. Delighted that he would never have to worry about pithas again, the shepherd swung his legs joyfully under the tree. Just then, an old, haggard woman appeared. The shepherd was unaware that she was actually a witch.

The shepherd, now having plenty of pithas, didn't hesitate to share.

“Alright, Grandma, I'll give you a pitha. But how will you take it?”

“Just place it in my hand,” the old woman replied.

“But the pitha is too hot. It might burn your hand.”

“Then put it in my mouth,” she suggested.

“Oh, Grandma, you don’t understand! The pitha is still hot. It could burn your mouth.”

The old woman slowly pulled out a large sack and said, "Son, then please put the pitha in this bag. Oh, what a wonderful smell! I haven't had a pitha in so long."

Hearing the sweet words of the old woman, the herdsman plucked a pitha and was about to put it in the sack when suddenly, the old woman grabbed him by the neck and, with a swift move, stuffed the entire boy into the sack. Before the herdsman could even comprehend what was happening, it was all over. After that, the witch, in a burst of joy, started singing in a shrill, eerie voice as she made her way through the forest:

"Hau Mau Kau,

Is anyone listening out there now?

If I find a human, quick as can be,

I'll gobble them up, gulp, and glee,

Tonight will be a feast for me!"

As the witch continued singing her eerie song, she began to feel extremely thirsty. Despite being a witch, she wasn’t as strong as she used to be and quickly became exhausted. She left the sack under a tree and went to fetch some water.

At that very moment, a group of young shepherds was passing by along the forest path.The shepherd boys, hoping to find something valuable, opened the witch's sack and immediately saw that it was their friend inside. They quickly rescued him and replaced him with pebbles, stones, pieces of wood, and other trash. When the witch returned home, she excitedly told everyone,

"Today, I've caught a strong young man. Tonight's meal is going to be a feast!"

But where was the young man? The sack contained only pebbles and stones. The witch got very angry. She was determined to teach the shepherd boy a lesson. The next day, she went back to the pitha tree. She managed to sweet-talk the shepherd boy into giving her a pitha again.

But did the old woman really want to eat the pitha? Her eyes were fixed on the shepherd boy. As soon as the boy started filling the sack with pitha, the old woman seized him by the neck and quickly stuffed him into the sack again. The shepherd boy realized there was no escape this time.

The old woman took the sack home and told her daughter-in-law, "Make sure to wash, cut, and cook everything properly before we all return home. We should have the food ready as soon as we get back." The shepherd boy, sitting inside the sack, overheard everything and began devising a plan in his mind.

As soon as the little witch opened the sack, the shepherd boy spoke, "Ugh, your teeth are so disgusting! With teeth like that, your husband will run away." The little witch was quite naive and immediately covered her teeth, saying, "How can my teeth be as white and shiny as yours? Tell me, please." The shepherd boy then said, "It's not that difficult! Just heat up some strong oil and bring a funnel."

Then the oil was heated up on the stove, and the shepherd boy continued to think of his next plan. When the oil was bubbling hot, he misled the little witch and poured all the hot oil into her mouth using the funnel. The little witch was burned and scalded by the boiling oil.

Then, the shepherd boy cleaned her up, cooked her properly, and dressed in her jewelry and clothes while waiting for the big witch. At night, when everyone sat down to eat, they were served the cooked meat of the witch's little daughter. No one realized what they were eating. Everyone thought it was just the meat of the shepherd boy who had been so troublesome.

After the meal, the shepherd boy, in the guise of the little witch, and the old witch went to the riverbank to wash their hands. As soon as they finished washing, the shepherd boy suddenly jumped into the river. The old witch was taken aback!

“Oh, wife, don’t go! There are crocodiles in the river. Don’t go!”

The shepherd boy then turned around and said, “You miserable old woman, who is your wife! See what's inside your belly!”

Saying this, the shepherd boy swam swiftly back home, leaving the crocodiles behind. The witch was so defeated that she never even went near the pitha tree again.
