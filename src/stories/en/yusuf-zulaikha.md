> The earliest known reference to today's story dates back 3500 years. The Book of Genesis recounts the tale of Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers. He was subsequently purchased by Potiphar, the captain of the Egyptian Pharaoh's guard. Potiphar's wife, whose name remains undisclosed, attempts to seduce Joseph, and his refusal leads to his imprisonment. Two thousand years later, the Holy Quran also tells a similar rendition of the story. Potiphar is now referred to as Al-Aziz, and the rest of the narrative bears resemblances with some minor variations. Eight hundred years thereafter, the Persian poet Jami assigns a name to the nameless woman, calling her Zulekha. Drawing inspiration from Sufi tradition, he composes a poem that envisions a romance between Yusuf and Zulekha. However, this is no ordinary love. Jami reinterprets Zulekha's infatuation as a yearning for a genuine spiritual connection with God himself. Lastly, in the 15th century, the Bengali poet Shah Muhammad Sagir translates Jami's version, relocating the events to Bengal and incorporating his own material, which encompasses Zulekha's childhood.

King Taimush had a daughter named Zulekha. She was very young, only nine years old at the time. However, in those days, it was common for women to be considered old by the time they reached twenty, so age didn’t matter much in this context. At such a tender age, Zulekha dreamt of an extraordinarily handsome man. In her dream, she fell in love with him, feeling that he was her husband and her destiny. This wasn’t just a one-time dream; Zulekha had this vision three times. First, there was a hint of him, then the exact location—she had learned everything about the mysterious man.

Zulekha herself wasn’t lacking in beauty. The beloved daughter of her parents, the princess of the royal palace, Zulekha was adored and cherished by all.

> "Her blooming youth, a girl who conquered all arts,

>

> Like the autumn moon, surrounded by stars."

>

At that time, girls were married at a very young age. Even in royal families, this was no exception. However, Zulekha’s marriage was as mysterious as her life. The man she had seen in her dreams three times turned out to be the King of Egypt. After realizing this in her third dream, Zulekha wasted no time and told her father that she wanted to marry the King of Egypt. Her father, pleased with her choice, sent a letter to the Egyptian king:

> “I have a daughter, and she desires no one but you. If you accept her, all my kingdom and wealth will be yours.”

>

The king at the time was Fatifur, also known as Aziz Misir, and he gladly accepted this proposal. Thus, a grand wedding took place.

But what was this! On the first night of her marriage, Zulekha’s head was struck with confusion. This was not the man from her dreams. She had never seen him before. Could it be that fate had deceived her? Meanwhile, Aziz Misir, her new husband, was quite unaware of everything. So, Zulekha spent her days with him, but she never got too close to her husband. For, right after the wedding, she had heard a divine message:

> "O Zulekha, do not be impatient, do not despair. Be patient. The man from your dreams will indeed be your husband, and life will show you the way."

>

With that, Zulekha practiced patience. She continued managing the palace household, sometimes with deception and sometimes out of obligation. Days passed, nights came and went—Zulekha sat alone, thinking, wondering, where was the husband fate had promised her?

Zulekha's dream man was named Yusuf. He was a fate-driven individual, yet one who took control of his own destiny. The true form of Yusuf was known only to his father and Zulekha. It was his loss that had caused his father, Yaqub, to lose his vision, and for that very reason, Zulekha herself had been considered a fallen, dishonored woman. But what was the secret behind Yusuf’s unparalleled beauty?

When Yusuf had been a slave, there came a time when he immersed himself in the Nile River to relieve his fatigue. It was the touch of the Nile that transformed him, granting him beauty and charm that seemed a hundred times greater.

> “Pure and elegant, his form was the pinnacle of beauty, An extraordinary form, more dazzling than even Indra. In the three worlds, he surpassed all in splendor, His face radiated moonlight, illuminating everything around him.”

>

However, Yusuf's fate was not as fortunate on the family front. At a very young age, he was betrayed by his own brothers, and became a slave. His life consisted of following his master on foreign journeys, with little control over his own destiny. Yet, Yusuf possessed some supernatural abilities. He could predict many things about people, reveal numerous mysteries, and his actions and manners were so refined that everyone who met him found him endearing. Many were so captivated by his charm that they became almost mesmerized by him. Perhaps this too was part of Yusuf's magical allure, a power that made him even more extraordinary than anyone could imagine.

Yusuf’s master, after wandering through various lands with him, finally reached Egypt, but this journey was also a result of Yusuf’s own will. Upon seeing Yusuf’s unparalleled beauty, everyone was captivated. News of the stunning slave reached the ears of the Pharaoh. The king decided he must either purchase this slave or at least see him for himself. The queen, along with her maidens, accompanied the king to witness this remarkable servant.

When Zuleikha, the queen, laid her eyes on Yusuf, she lost all sense of reason. This was the man from her dreams, the one she had been searching for all along. But how could the king’s slave be the one she sought? Zuleikha, however, was not concerned with this. She only desired him. So, she demanded the slave in exchange for all the king’s riches. The king, unable to refuse his queen’s request, agreed.

Thus, Yusuf became a part of the Egyptian royal court, and Zuleikha took full responsibility for him. But a complication arose. When handing over Yusuf to her, the king, Aziz Misir, instructed Zuleikha,

> “Treat him as you would your own son.”

>

This was because, through his miraculous abilities, Yusuf had returned all of the king’s lost wealth. This act of kindness made the king extremely fond of Yusuf.

Zuleikha's feelings for Yusuf had long since ceased to resemble that of a mother. Instead, she continually tried to express her love for him. But Yusuf, unaware of the twists of fate, continued to reject her advances, always asserting that the king's wishes were his highest priority. Time passed in this cycle—sometimes in conflict, sometimes in comfort and indulgence.

During this period, Zuleikha had a beautiful house built specifically for Yusuf. The craftsmanship of the house was unmatched, surpassing any architecture of its time. The house had four pillars made of silver, and the roof was made of gold. In each corner of the room, there were silver fawns and two golden statues of servants. The doors were made from the finest sandalwood and ivory. Within this grand house was another room, entirely enclosed in glass from top to bottom, where Zuleikha kept Yusuf.

The king, Aziz Misir, soon realized the queen's intentions, but he could not confront her directly without bringing dishonor upon himself. So, he imprisoned Yusuf to prevent further actions. Time passed, and eventually, King Aziz Misir passed away. Upon his death, a new ruler, the Eastern Prince, took the throne. During his reign, Yusuf was released from imprisonment. He assisted the king with advice on governance, and after the prince's death, Yusuf became the ruler of Egypt himself.

After the death of Aziz Misir, Zuleikha had grown much older. Her beauty and grace, along with her servants and attendants, had all faded. She now lived by the roadside, passing her days in sorrow for Yusuf's separation. Once a queen, she had become a beggar, and with the passing years, she had lost her sight as well. It seemed to be a cruel twist of fate! As Yusuf, the once enslaved man, now ruled as the king, Zuleikha, a former queen, had become a beggar.

Zuleikha, now blind, lived by the very path Yusuf walked. She had made her home beside it, sitting day and night in silent waiting. But the king's men would not let her meet him. Her wait seemed to stretch on forever.

One day, however, her wait came to an end. That morning, Yusuf had gone on a journey without his usual entourage. As he passed by, he saw an old beggar woman sitting by the side of the road, crying out for mercy. Her cries moved the king's heart. He approached her and asked,

> "What is it you seek? I will grant you whatever you ask."

>

Just as a parched bird is calmed by a sip of water, Zuleikha's heart was soothed by his words. She replied,

> "I pray for the restoration of my sight."

>

And at that moment, her vision was miraculously restored. She could see once more, and before her stood the radiant figure of Yusuf.

Overcome with gratitude and joy, Zuleikha then asked for two more blessings.

Zuleikha then spoke with a voice full of longing, "Yusuf, listen! This is the form I had, the very form I had when I was youthful, a form that existed in the seven divisions of Tongti. Give me back that beauty and youth, even if I can't be equal to you, may you be mine in this moment!"

Yusuf, hearing this strange request, was taken aback. For at that moment, he could not recognize Zuleikha. As he stood there, suddenly a voice echoed from the heavens:

> "This shall be your wife, this is your fate. You will accept her, and you two shall be united."

>

Finally, fate had completed its circle. The union of the two was destined to be. The dream that Zuleikha had seen so many years ago—of marrying the king of Egypt—was now realized. The two of them, now a newlywed couple, settled in a beautiful Tongti, where they lived peacefully. According to Shah Sogir, it was in this Tongti that they had two children together, though this detail is not mentioned in other records.

This was the culmination of a long journey—a tale of dreams, destiny, separation, and reunion, where love and fate finally intertwined.
