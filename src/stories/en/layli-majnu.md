For many days, the Arab king felt troubled. He had done much for his subjects and had fulfilled his duties as a king properly. However, he had no children in his home. The king decided that he would go into the jungle. But his loyal minister stopped him.

In the same kingdom, four years later, a daughter was born to the merchant Aziz, who was known for her enchanting beauty. Her name was Laila. Laila and Qais studied together at school, exchanging books and learning side by side, which fostered a story of friendship between them. As they grew older, that friendship gradually transformed into love—a secret known only to the two of them.

But could such feelings truly remain hidden? Qais was then 18 years old, while Laila had just turned 14. Laila's mother disapproved of her spending time with the prince and decided to end her education. Meanwhile, day after day, Qais waited anxiously for Laila to return. Laila, in turn, spent her days without eating or sleeping, consumed by her longing. In his desperation for Laila, Qais abandoned his royal life and studies, wandering the streets like a beggar.

People began to call him Laila's Majnu. Majnu would go to Laila's house as a beggar, cleverly avoiding everyone's notice, and Laila would give him alms. Just seeing Laila once a day brought him joy. But one day, Laila's mother noticed this situation and issued a decree: "From now on, you are forbidden to go outside the veil! You can no longer give alms to the beggar." And so it went. In the separation of Laila and Majnu, the leaves of the trees fell, and the birds of the forest flew away, crying.

“Majnu, hearing your cries,

The captive has broken her cage,

And ventured out to the path,

From the desert river to the mountains.”

On the other side, in Majnu's home, everyone was in mourning. The elderly king found no way out, and the queen was in a state of distress. They learned that their beloved son was now spending his days beneath the trees in the forest. The king set out to find his son. However, the son could not recognize his father, for only one name echoed in his mind—“Laili, Laili!” The king then tried to deceive him. He said, “Majnu, Layli is waiting for you. Come with me.”

Majnu then began to walk behind the king like a madman. Even upon reaching the royal palace, there was no change in Majnu's condition. He only searched for Layli here and there. At that moment, a man came and informed the king that a hermit had arrived in the kingdom. He was an enlightened being, and surely he could help cure Majnu!

The hermit told the king about a strange remedy: "Listen, O King. Majnu has gone mad for Laili, and it is Layli herself who will be the cure. Take thread cut by Laili's hand and use it to make clothing for Majnu; that way, he won't tear his clothes anymore. Also, take some earth from Laili's home and apply it to Majnu's eyes; this will stop him from crying like a madman." Needless to say, this treatment significantly reduced Majnu's madness.

The king sighed with relief. He decided that if his son's happiness lay with Laili, he would arrange Majnu's marriage to her. The proposal was sent to the merchant, and the king himself presented a hundred gifts, jewels, and gems, saying, "Brother, I wish to marry Layli to Qais. What do you say?" The merchant hesitated and replied, "Your Majesty, this is my great fortune! But we must also consider the girl's perspective. People say Qais is mad! He is now known as Majnu! Is it possible to marry my daughter to such a boy?" The king reassured the merchant that Qais had recovered. To prove this, he summoned Majnu to the royal court. At first, Majnu remained calm, as he was wearing Laili's touched garment and the soil. But fate had other plans; suddenly, a puppy appeared in the royal court. Someone whispered in Majnu's ear, "The dog is very dear to Laili!" Instantly, Majnu abandoned his royal seat and rolled in the dust, playing with the puppy. It looked as if he was not a prince, but a foolish child! Laili's father, feeling disheartened, glanced at the king and left the assembly. The marriage did not happen after all.

Layli only talks about Majnu and cries in his name; she has no attention for anything else. Laili's mother became very angry and arranged for her to marry a prince from a faraway land. Although Layli was married against her will, she did not accept the new husband and rejected him. She remained at her parents' house. Everyone around began to speak ill of Laili, and no one wanted to talk to her properly anymore. Yet, none of it seemed to bother her. Grieving, Layli sat like a stone, sometimes crying, sometimes lost in thoughts of Majnu.

In that kingdom, there lived a sorceress who was also a witch. Seeing his daughter's madness, the merchant decided to seek the help of this sorceress. She was an old woman, and anyone who saw her would immediately feel a sense of enchantment. Following the merchant's instructions, the sorceress went to Majnu in the forest. She told him many lies in Laili's name, claiming that Layli was very happy in her new life and perhaps had forgotten all about him.

Hearing all this, Majnu was overwhelmed with rage and sorrow. He wrote a letter to Layli and gave it to the old woman. The old woman, feigning sorrow, delivered the letter to Layli and spoke ill of Majnu. Layli then sat down to reply to the letter. However, while sharpening her pen, she accidentally cut her finger. Using the bloodied finger, she wrote her response to Majnu.

Meanwhile, from Majnu's hands, blood began to flow as well, a reflection of their shared sorrow. After reading the letter, Majnu rushed to Laili, disguised as a beggar. For a fleeting moment, they were united again, and the misunderstandings between them were resolved. The enchantress's magic faltered in the face of their love. Yet, the world is harsh, and Majnu could not stay with the married Laili. He had to return to the forest, to the birds and trees. There, he encountered the prince who was Laili's husband according to their customs.

The prince had come to see Majnu, driven by a deep curiosity about the man for whom his bride had refused to return. Despite his sorrow, he hadn't even been able to see his new wife's face. However, after talking with Majnu for a while, the prince's heart softened. He promised Majnu that he would do everything in his power to unite him with Laili, even if it meant fighting against her parents.

Determined, the prince gathered his soldiers and, with a strong resolve, launched an attack on the merchant's house to bring Layli back for Majnu.

But the prince's heart wavered. Before handing Layli over to anyone, he desperately wished to see her once more. As he gazed upon Laili’s enchanting face, he forgot the promise he made to Majnu about their separation or reunion. Together with his minister, the prince began to plot, deciding that Majnu must be removed from the equation by any means necessary!

The minister devised a wicked plan, suggesting that on the wedding day, Majnu would be given a poisoned drink disguised as a refreshing sherbet. When Majnu would fall lifeless from the poison, there would be no obstacle left for the prince to claim Layli as his own.

On the wedding day, the surroundings were adorned with vibrant red and blue lights, creating a festive atmosphere. Majnu was dressed in wedding attire and seated on a throne embellished with jewels, right beside the prince. Attendants bustled about, and soon, the poisoned sherbet was served. Both the prince and Majnu took a sip, but fate took an unexpected turn. Instead of Majnu, it was the prince who fell victim to the poison, collapsing to the ground in an instant.

The prince met his demise from the poison he had brought himself. Meanwhile, Layli and Majnu found themselves separated once again. Witnessing such envy from a friend tore Majnu's heart anew. Having lost all loved ones, peace, and happiness in the name of one love, Majnu no longer sought a reunion. He vanished among the flowers and beneath the trees—lost in the clouds of pollen drifting in the air, his thoughts were consumed by Laili, only Laili. As for Laili, her love for Majnu had ascended to heights beyond her own existence, captured in the waves of deep emotion that surged through Majnu.

Laili, I have returned,

Majnu, open your eyes.”

Indeed, Layli had come to Majnu. But her arrival had been too long in coming. In that moment, Majnu replied,

“It is impossible for us to unite in this world. Look up at the sky; there awaits an everlasting paradise adorned with flowers—two thrones on either side, my dear, just for us!”

And perhaps that is exactly what happened. Shortly after, Layli passed away in her father’s home, grieving deeply, while Majnu met his end amidst the animals of the forest. Only the immortal tale of Layli and Majnu remained, echoing through the ages.
