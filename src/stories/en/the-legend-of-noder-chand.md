In a time long gone, Gadadhar, a fisherman, lived in a modest hut by the Madhumati River with his wife. They sustained their small family through his skillful catches in the river's depths. Soon, their joy was doubled as his wife became pregnant, bringing with it not only excitement but also the worry of providing for their growing family.

As the seasons turned and summer faded, the monsoons arrived. This period, with its abundant rain, brought the best fishing season of the year. In anticipation, Gadadhar, along with the other fishermen of the village, began preparing their nets and boats, eager to harvest the bounty of the river. However, amidst the preparations, his wife expressed her fears. She worried that if she were to die during childbirth, she wouldn't see Gadadhar again. But, Gadadhar reassured her, and when a promising day arrived, he joined the other fishermen, setting sail on the Madhumati River, leaving his wife behind with a mix of hope and anxiety for his safe return.

Meanwhile, the other fishermen returned home, one by one, with their boats laden with fish. But Gadadhar's boat remained absent. Days turned into weeks, and weeks dragged into months. The monsoon season ended, leaving behind a sense of emptiness in the village and in Gadadhar's wife's heart. One day, a group of fishermen arrived, bearing grim news. They told Gadadhar's wife that his boat had been caught in a sudden storm on the river and sunk. Despite searching tirelessly, they couldn't find Gadadhar. Grief overwhelmed Gadadhar's wife as she realized she had become a widow far too soon. However, amidst the sorrow, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Holding him close, she named him Nader Chand. In her child, she saw a new beginning, a reason to keep hope alive. Despite the immense loss she had suffered, she dreamed of a new life, a life she would build with her son Nader Chand by her side.

Nader Chand, raised with boundless maternal love, blossomed from adolescence into a young man. He yearned to follow in his father's footsteps and fish in the river's gentle current. However, his mother harbored different dreams for her son. She envisioned him married, raising a family, and tilling the fertile land for a secure livelihood. With unwavering determination, she arranged a marriage for Nader Chand with Sarala, a stunning young woman from the fishermen's community. At thirteen, Sarala was a vision of youthful beauty, and her parents readily accepted the proposal. But Nader Chand, yearning for adventure and independence, vanished into the night without a word. He stepped into the unknown, leaving behind a heartbroken mother who drowned her sorrow in endless tears. Day after day, her grief consumed her, eventually robbing her of her sight.

Ten years flew by like a dream. Everyone had given up hope, assuming that Gadadhar's son, Nader Chand, would never return, just like his father. But one day, out of the blue, he reappeared, proving everyone wrong. Filled with remorse for his mother's blindness, Chand embraced her tightly, tears streaming down his face. The old woman, overwhelmed with joy after finding her son after so many years, could barely contain her happiness.

Determined to keep his son at home, Gadadhar quickly arranged his marriage to a young woman named Sarala. Nader Chand was instantly drawn to his wife's innocent nature and beautiful face, and soon found himself swept away by the simple joys of life. He started his days working in the fields, returning home in the afternoon for a hearty home-cooked meal. After dinner each night, he would sit with his wife, lost in conversation. This peaceful routine became his new reality, surrounded by the love of his mother and wife.

One day, Sarala, unable to hold back her curiosity any longer, questioned her husband about the ten years he vanished. Nader Chand tried to avoid answering, but his wife was relentless. Finally, under pressure, Chand opened up and revealed the tale of a fantastical land called [Kamakhya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakhya_Temple). He described how he spent the last decade in this magical realm, where people could disappear in the blink of an eye, turn into animals, and even resurrect the dead. Sarala listened in stunned silence, captivated by these incredible stories.

Chand extracted a promise from her to keep these secrets buried, and over time, he regaled her with more tales of Kamakhya. One day, he recounted a particularly bizarre story - how people in Kamakhya possessed the ability to morph into crocodiles. As he spoke, Sarala's eyes widened with surprise. Another time, he confessed to learning this very art from a female guru during his stay. He described his teacher's powers and even revealed her name and residence in detail. Intrigued, Sarala implored Chand to transform into a crocodile. Despite his initial reluctance, unable to resist his wife's pleas any longer, Chand finally agreed. He promised to appear as a crocodile in the dead of night, when everyone was asleep.

As midnight struck, Nader Chand entered the house clutching a pot of water. He chanted a mystical incantation and blew onto the surface of the water. "Reciting this mantra," he explained to his wife, "will allow me to transform into a crocodile. After I do, sprinkling this enchanted water on my body will return me to human form." With that, Chand climbed onto the bed and lay down, anticipation hanging heavy in the air.

Sarala, brimming with curiosity, waited impatiently beside the bed, eager to witness her husband's transformation. Moments later, a crocodile-shaped Chand emerged from beneath the covers. The sight of this horrifying creature sent shivers down Sarala's spine. A scream ripped from her throat as she bolted out of the room, leaving the pot of water tumbling to the floor in a shattered mess. Nader Chand watched helplessly as his wife fled in terror. Once outside, Sarala slammed the door shut, leaving Chand trapped in his monstrous form. By the time she left, the earthen floor had already absorbed all the enchanted water. Yet, Nader Chand continued to roll and writhe on the damp ground, desperately hoping to regain his human form. Meanwhile, Sarala sat weeping outside the door, her heart pounding with fear. Hearing the commotion, Nader Chand's mother rushed to the scene. As soon as she arrived, Sarala embraced her tightly and poured out the entire story. After listening to the tale, Chand's mother made a daring decision. She would somehow find a way to bring the sorceress from Kamakhya - the woman who had taught Chand these dangerous magical arts.

Chand's elderly mother, accompanied by her daughter-in-law, embarked on a journey to Kamakhya. Meanwhile, Nader Chand remained imprisoned within his own home for three grueling days. The pangs of hunger gnawed at him relentlessly, growing stronger with each passing moment. Driven by the desperation of his craving stomach, he shattered the flimsy door and burst free, sending shockwaves of panic through the surrounding area. People rushed towards the sight of the monstrous crocodile, their fear palpable. With no other escape available, Chand plunged into the Madhumati River, seeking refuge in its depths. From that day onwards, he made the river his home.

After a month and thirteen days, Chand's mother and wife returned from Kamakhya, accompanied by his guru, Sadhika. Filled with urgency, Sadhika rushed to the very ghat where Chand had vanished into the Madhumati's depths. Standing on the bank, she called out to him. In response, the crocodile-like Chand emerged from the water, his jaws clamped around a large hilsa fish, half devoured. The sight sent a pang through Sadhika's heart. It was clear - Chand had succumbed to his hunger and begun eating. This transformation was irreversible. He was forever bound to the river, his human form a fading memory.

Grief-stricken, Nader Chand's wife sat on the riverbank, tears streaming down her face for the mistakes she had made. Unable to bear the unbearable, Nader had taken his own life by leaping into the rushing waters. Each day, under the pale light of the moon, Nader's mother would visit the banks of the Madhumati River. As she called out her son's name, a crocodile-shaped form would rise from the depths. It was Chand, transformed by the river's magic. After accepting food from his mother's loving hands, he would slip back into the embrace of the Madhumati, leaving her alone with her sorrow until the next moonlit night.

Even today, the legend of Nader Chand echoes through Boalmari upazila in Faridpur district. Schools, post offices, and villages bear his name, a testament to his enduring legacy.
