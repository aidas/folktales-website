It was a long time ago. In the city of Rome, there lived a childless king named Sher Shah. He had not one, but seven queens in his palace. The youngest of these queens was named Kusum. When this youngest queen became pregnant, the king’s affection for her grew significantly. Because of this, the other six queens could not tolerate Kusum.

During childbirth, the senior queen conspired with the midwife and secretly replaced Queen Kusum's baby with a wooden doll, making it seem as though Kusum had given birth to the doll. The real baby was taken to the senior queen's chambers. The queen immediately commanded the midwife, “Take this child away from my sight and kill it with a sharp weapon.” However, the midwife, filled with compassion, couldn’t bring herself to kill the child. Instead, she decided to leave the kingdom and take the baby to another land, sparing its life.

Meanwhile, in the town of Shyamsundar, the vizier Kalander also had no children. The midwife, carrying the baby, went to Kalander’s house and offered to sell the child. The midwife told the vizier, “The baby has no father, and the mother passed away during childbirth. The child is now my responsibility—but I am unable to raise it on my own.” After hearing everything, the vizier went to discuss the matter with his wives.

The vizier's wives said, "We can keep the baby on one condition—buy us a milking cow! The child will drink its milk and will not suffer any harm." The midwife and the vizier both agreed to this proposal. Soon after, the vizier made a grand announcement throughout the kingdom, with drums beating and fanfare, proclaiming that he had a newborn son.

Meanwhile, a servant named Kalu went to inform Sher Shah that his youngest queen, Kusum, had given birth to a wooden doll. The king, refusing to believe this, first went to hear from his six elder queens. Each of them, one by one, confirmed the story. Angered by what he heard, the king imprisoned Queen Kusum and declared that the matter would be judged the following morning in the royal court.

The next morning, Queen Kusum was brought to the royal court in chains. In the court, she pleaded, "It was no wooden doll; a son was born to me—known to all, friend and foe alike. My son’s name is Askhan, and the heavens would split open for him." However, since the child was not present, the king berated her. Kusum fell at her husband's feet, begging for mercy. But the king, still enraged, stripped her of her eight ornaments and left her in disgrace.

Then the king commanded Kaloo to cut Kusum's hair, pour mud over her head, and hang the wooden doll around her neck, while pushing her out of the kingdom. Along with that, the king also ordered that Queen Kusum be banished to the forest for twelve years. As per the king's orders, this was carried out. The queen was sent deep into the forest.

Kusum walked through the forest, and as night fell, she began to feel afraid—thinking that a tiger would eat her in this dense jungle. Then she saw a flickering light a little distance ahead. She thought to herself, “I’ll spend the night there and leave in the morning.”

Kusum approached the house and pleaded with the homeowner to allow her to stay for one night. The homeowner agreed but set one condition: she must leave before dawn. After spending the night there, Kusum set out at first light toward her parents' home. Upon arriving, she embraced her mother and, in tears, recounted everything that had happened during her banishment.

But Kusum's father did not allow her to enter the house. Ironically, she was now a queen in distress, with nowhere to go. With no other option, she went to her brother's house, but there too, she found no refuge and was driven away. Heartbroken, Kusum retreated into the forest, crying out the name of her newborn son, Askan. In the forest lived countless tigers, and upon hearing the name Askan, they compassionately built her a small hut from palm and bel leaves for shelter. Kusum managed to survive by begging for food, making do with whatever little she could gather each day.

Before long, twelve years passed—twelve winters and twelve springs. But could a mother ever forget her child? One day, while going to school through the forest path, little Askan happened to see Kusum. Upon seeing her, he called out from the depths of his heart, "Mother!" With the pain of being separated from her son, Kusum replied, "Come, my child, drink your mother's milk."

Askan continued to drink Kusum's milk with unending satisfaction, and meanwhile, the school hours came to an end. After finishing his meal, Kusum asked Askan for food and inquired about his lineage. Askan promised her that he would find out from his mother and would return with food as well.

Askan, upon asking the midwife about his true lineage, learned the entire story. Crying, he returned to the forest to meet Kusum. After twelve years, the mother and son were reunited, both overwhelmed with emotion. Then, Askan took his mother, Kusum, to the court of King Sher Shah. There, all the hidden truths from the years were revealed, and King Sher Shah sentenced the elder queen to death, deeply regretting her actions.

Finally, everyone was reunited. King Sher Shah began to rule the kingdom happily with Queen Kusum and their son, Askan. Thus, the tale of Queen Kusum came to an end.
