In a certain country, there lived a merchant named Alal Saudagar. He lived happily with his beautiful wife and son, Dulal. As Dulal grew older, when he turned twelve, he insisted on going hunting in the deep forest. His parents couldn’t refuse their only son, even though they had a bad feeling about it. Despite their worries, they allowed Dulal to venture into the woods. Once in the forest, he lost his way and couldn't find the path back home. Wandering aimlessly, Dulal became a drifter, as if the magic of the forest made him forget about returning to his parents.

On the other hand, Rupa Sundari's beauty seemed to fade day by day with worry for her son. Alal Saudagar's trading ship sank, yet Dulal did not return home. How could he? He had lost his way and ended up in a completely different land.

In that new land, Dulal met the king, Salim Badshah. The king asked him, "Boy, where is your home?" Dulal, unable to recall much about his home, simply replied, "In an unknown city." Seeing the boy’s carefree nature, the king felt pity for him and decided to keep him close. Dulal roamed freely and lived comfortably, with no memory of his past life.

In the meantime, Dulal had grown strong and robust. One day, he thought to himself, "How long will I continue to live idly, doing nothing? What will people say? It's time I find some work." Even though he had little interest in work, these thoughts led him to approach the king. Dulal asked for a task, and the king readily handed him the keys to the royal granary, instructing him to manage it carefully. At the end of the year, the king would expect an account of the granary from Dulal.

Though Dulal had taken on the responsibility of managing the granary, keeping track of it was not his forte. He ate some of the supplies, let some go to waste, and invited anyone he came across to help themselves to the granary. In just a few days, the royal granary was in utter disarray due to Dulal's negligence.

Meanwhile, Dulal's parents, Alal Saudagar and Rup Sundari, were frantically searching for him across distant lands. They had handed over all their wealth to the caretaker and now wandered as beggars. One day, by a stroke of fate, they arrived at the gates of King Salim's palace, disguised as a poor couple. But alas, misfortune struck—Dulal, now absorbed in his duties at the royal granary and blinded by the luxuries of palace life, failed to recognize his own parents.

Dulal didn’t even glance at them, and in their sorrow, the merchant and Rup Sundari passed away that very day. That night, Dulal dreamt of the moon and sun falling from the sky and crashing to the ground. Though he couldn’t make sense of the dream, it left him deeply unsettled. His restless heart became even more troubled. Without telling anyone, he took the king’s horse from the stable and set off into the unknown in the dead of night.

No one had a clue that Dulal had left the kingdom. By then, he had wandered into a new, unknown realm. Deep within a forest of that land, he tied his horse under a tree and lay down to sleep. Suddenly, a bear woke him up and said,

"The one who’s come here—food for the enchantress’s feast.  

What will this lost traveler do? By tomorrow, he'll be her beast!"

Dulal paid no attention to the bear and lay down again, undisturbed. The bear, though kind-hearted and harmless, neither ate anyone nor caused fear. Its sole purpose was to warn forest dwellers of the dangers posed by enchantresses. But when Dulal ignored its warning, the bear simply went back home, baffled. It had never encountered such a stubborn boy before!

The night passed like this. As soon as Dulal ventured out of the jungle the next day, an enchantress caught him in her spell. No matter which way Dulal turned, he always ended up in the same spot. He had no objections to falling under her control. When the enchantress asked him to marry her, Dulal happily agreed. She performed magic while Dulal watched in awe. Fascinated by her powers, he too wanted to learn magic. One by one, his new bride taught him every spell. Dulal had never met anyone as intriguing as her.

Dulal mastered all sorts of magic—tree magic, fish magic, and more—until everything was within his grasp. After a while, they had a son, but the child of a human and an enchantress faced challenges. Soon, the boy passed away, and Dulal's heart shattered. He informed his wife that he could no longer stay there and decided to leave for a new land. However, his wife was no ordinary woman; she was a renowned enchantress. She would not let him go so easily, especially since Dulal was her own disciple.

For quite some time, a peculiar magical battle ensued between them. The wife cast her spells, but Dulal quickly countered them. Suddenly, the enchantress transformed into a massive banyan tree. Dulal, however, remained unfazed and continued on his path, undeterred by any obstacles in his way.

In this new land, Dulal heard the sounds of drums and festivities all around him. He asked the people and learned that the king’s palace was in need of soldiers! Seizing the opportunity, Dulal took the job. To bond with another soldier, he asked, "Brother, is there a wedding at the king's palace?" The soldier replied, "Oh, brother, there’s a wedding every day! The king's daughter needs a new groom daily. No one knows where the old grooms go!"

Hearing this, Dulal wondered what the mystery meant. That night, he couldn't sleep. He kept watch outside the princess's room. Eventually, he saw a mad ascetic taking the new groom away. Dulal followed him and saw the ascetic performing some rituals while seated with the king's groom. Looking around, the ascetic gobbled up the groom! Dulal's eyes widened in shock. This wasn’t an ascetic; it was a demon! Today, he had taken the princess as well!

Today, he felt particularly hungry. He also had to keep an eye on the new soldier—he was quite plump! Just then, Dulal stepped forward and said, “Ascetic, please show me how to perform the worship!” “What a surprise!” thought the ascetic, “He has come to me himself. Let me show him the rituals.” As soon as the demon in ascetic guise lowered his head, Dulal swiftly severed it with his sword. He turned to the princess and said, “Don’t be afraid. I am Dulal the soldier, roaming the roads.”

Hearing the commotion, the king and everyone from the royal palace rushed there. Finally, it became clear where the king's sons-in-law had been disappearing every night! Both the king and the princess were very pleased with Dulal's cleverness. Dulal became the king’s new son-in-law. But who knew how long he would be satisfied with this new role, given his restless nature? Perhaps soon he would embark on another adventure. However, for quite some time, there was no news about Dulal; it was said he had settled down and was living a comfortable family life.
