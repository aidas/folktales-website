It was a long time ago. In a corner of the village lived a young orphan named Sushil. Though his father had passed away when he was very young, his mother had only left him a few days ago. Since then, Sushil had neither cared to bathe nor eat. His home, too, had fallen into disarray, with nothing in order.

Sushil would just lie in a corner of his house, reminiscing about the old days and his mother's love. When his mother was alive, he used to spend entire days collecting seashells by the shore. It's been so long since he last gathered shells—he had almost forgotten those days entirely.

After many such days had passed, one day the sun shone brightly, breaking through all the clouds. Sushil felt the desire to soak up some of that sunlight. As he wandered around in the warmth, his spirits unexpectedly lifted. And right then, his eyes caught sight of a strange and beautiful seashell. Seeing this shell, he didn’t feel like eating it, but rather, he wanted to keep it. So, carefully cradling the shell in his palm, Sushil took it home.

After wandering all day, a tired Sushil had fallen asleep. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he was astonished to see that his previously disordered home was no longer in disarray. Someone had carefully and neatly arranged everything. There it was—the pot of rice steaming away. Nearby, dishes were arranged, and a pan of curry was simmering as well.

Sushil rubbed his eyes, trying to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. There was no one else in the house but him. Who could have done all this? Though he couldn’t figure it out, he did understand one thing—he was absolutely starving. With the delightful smell of rice wafting through the air, how could anyone resist? That afternoon, Sushil enjoyed a hearty meal.However, Sushil made a plan in his mind. The next time, he would pretend to be asleep and stay in bed. After all, he needed to see who was turning his messy house into a palace, as if by magic!

The next day, Sushil lay completely still, making not a sound. As soon as he pretended to sleep, he saw a breathtakingly beautiful girl emerge from the shell of the snail he had found. The moment the girl quietly stepped out of the snail's shell, her radiant light transformed Sushil's shabby room into something resembling a palace.

As soon as the girl emerged from the shell, she first swept the room, then put rice on the stove, chopped fish, and cooked vegetables. After completing all the chores, just as she was about to return to the snail, Sushil suddenly rushed forward and grabbed her. "Who are you? Why are you secretly doing all the work in my house?" The girl remained completely silent.

She didn’t say a word. Her gaze was fixed on the shell of the snail lying in the corner of the room. Since the girl had come out, the shell no longer looked as beautiful as before. Sushil became very angry and kicked the shell out of the house. It shattered into pieces.

Immediately, the girl exclaimed, "What have you done? What have you done?"

"Now tell me, who are you?" Sushil asked.

"Alright, but let me go first. I can't return to the shell now."

Feeling embarrassed, Sushil released her and said, "Now tell me your story."

Then the girl began to narrate a strange curse and the tale of her past life.

"My name is Shamak Kanya. I can't even say how long I have been living inside this shell. When I was very young, a wicked sorcerer trapped me in this shell. Because of him, I lost my father, my mother, and my entire family. "The sorcerer had cursed me, saying that I couldn't stay outside this shell for long. However, he also mentioned a way out: if ever a human were to break this shell, I would be freed. Today, you inadvertently did just that. You have liberated me from the sorcerer's curse. I will stay with you from now on."

Hearing the words of the Shell Princess, Sushil felt as if he had found the moon in his hands. She took him to a strange and enchanting place.

It is a kingdom where there are no people anywhere around. Only the damp earth stretches out, scattered with countless shells. The Shell Princess walked forward with a sweet smile and, placing her hand on one of the shells, it transformed into a human. Then, one by one, more people emerged from the shells. Sushil learned from the Shell Princess that they were all subjects of this kingdom. The Shell Princess was indeed the princess of this realm.

In an instant, a slumbering kingdom awakened. From the shells emerged a vast sea of people. The Shell Princess joyfully danced her way into the royal palace, the very place from which she had been banished by the sorcerer's curse. Sushil followed closely behind her. Inside the palace, many more shells were scattered about.

One by one, the Shell Princess's parents, the King and Queen, awoke, along with their attendants, guards, and soldiers. After so long, reuniting with their daughter and reclaiming their lives filled the King and Queen with overwhelming joy. Without hesitation, they welcomed Sushil as their son-in-law.

The next day, the old King announced, "From today, Sushil shall be the king of this realm." The unfortunate Sushil, now crowned, began to rule the kingdom alongside the Shell Princess. No wicked sorcerer ever dared to set foot in their kingdom again.
