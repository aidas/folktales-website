üí° The early 15th century marked the beginning of Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign over Bengal. During his rule, the upper-caste Hindus lived in luxury and comfort, while the lower castes were neglected and marginalized. It was during this time that Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, known in his early life as ‚ÄòNimai,‚Äô made his appearance. Born in 1486, Nimai‚Äôs life left a profound impact on the religious landscape, and he passed away in 1533. His death remains shrouded in mystery even today. Some believe that he disappeared on his own, while others suggest that he was murdered.

Nimai was quite renowned in his neighborhood. He ran a small school, or 'tol,' where he not only taught but also entertained the local boys with various stories beyond the usual lessons. His charismatic presence and engaging storytelling made his 'tol' a lively hub for learning and laughter.

At home, Nimai lived with his mother, Shachidevi, and his newly wedded wife, Vishnupriya. Before Vishnupriya, he was married to another sweet-natured girl named Lakshmipriya. Unfortunately, Lakshmipriya met a tragic end; she passed away after being bitten by a snake.

Nimai had an elder brother named Vishvarupa. Before Nimai could understand much, Vishvarupa left household life and became a monk. Since then, their mother Shachidevi has been very worried, fearing that the younger son might follow the same path! But the neighbors always praised Nimai and told her, "Don't worry, Shachi. Nimai won't become a monk." Nimai thought the same way.

He joyfully runs his school and manages his household. His nature is very lively. He is on good terms with the washerman and the grocer at the general store. Even without a single coin in his pocket, everyone comes and gives him things. Everyone loves Nimai dearly.

Once, Nimai went to Gaya Dham to perform the ritual of offering for his deceased father. After returning, he was no longer the same. He would lose consciousness frequently, and looking into his eyes, it seemed like nothing in the world interested him anymore. Even his beautiful wife Vishnupriya‚Äîif she said ten things, Nimai would only listen to one.

Mother Shachidevi noticed everything. Could it be that her fears were about to come true? She went to her friend Malini, crying, and said, ‚ÄúNimai isn‚Äôt like before, my friend. Since returning from Gaya, he seems different.‚Äù Malini dismissed her concerns, saying, ‚ÄúWhat change in Nimai? He‚Äôs always smiling. People say Nimai doesn‚Äôt walk on the road‚Äîhe practically flies! He‚Äôs such a spirited boy!‚Äù

But a mother‚Äôs heart senses everything. Now, Nimai‚Äôs face and eyes are filled only with Krishna‚Äôs name. The real story, however, is known to no one else. Only Nimai knows. And his guru is from Gaya‚Äîhis name is Ishwar Puri. When Nimai went to Gaya, he met him there. It was there that he received the mantra, but upon returning home, he told no one.

One day, Nimai woke up and started crying incessantly, then laughing at moments. Seeing his behavior, everyone thought Nimai had gone mad. Ignoring everyone else, Nimai said to his mother, "Someone appeared to me in my dream, Mother! A dark-complexioned youth, whose black hue seemed to illuminate the entire world."

"He looked at me in such a way, Mother, that it felt like his eyes were not just eyes‚Äîthey were two lotus flowers blooming in a pond! I must go to that youth, Mother. Don't stop me anymore."

A few days passed like this. Then one day, Nimai left home. Where he went after leaving, only a few of his close companions knew, but no one else did.

The people of the neighborhood murmured, "Nimai Pandit of Nabadwip has taken sannyas!" Shachi Maa sat with her head in her hands. No one saw when the kajal on Vishnupriya‚Äôs eyes was smeared by her tears. Nimai did return once, but only to bid farewell to his mother and wife.

Wearing a torn blanket, Nimai roams the streets. Whenever someone comes to beat him, he stretches out his arms and says, "Beat me!" His calm and gentle demeanor combined with this peculiar behavior stirs thoughts in people‚Äôs minds. They, too, start following Nimai, enchanted by some magical charm.

Nimai wins everyone over with talks of devotion, love, and compassion. His speech is filled with Krishna‚Äôs name, and he becomes ecstatic with every mention of it. Whenever he regains his senses, he resumes chanting Krishna‚Äôs name. One day, his friend Gadadhar came and scolded him severely, urging him to return home.

Nimai asked only one question, "Friend, can you tell me, where does Krishna reside?" Gadadhar then comforted him, saying, "Oh, Krishna resides in your heart‚Äîdon't you know?" Hearing this, the mad Nimai tried to cut open his chest. Such was his behavior. Years passed, and Nimai, now known as Sri Chaitanya, began his work of spreading religion in Navadvipa.

In Navadvipa, there lived two other brothers, Jagannath and Madhai. Together, they were known as Jagai-Madhai. Although their names had religious connotations, the two brothers were notorious rascals. One day, they would throw stones at someone's house, and the next, they would raid another's home. Being notorious drunkards, these brothers were responsible for maintaining order in the city. Far from being protectors, they were more like predators. No one liked them due to their rowdiness and thuggery, and many avoided them out of fear.

A close associate of Sri Chaitanya was Nityananda. One day, he noticed the names of Jagai and Madhai. He thought, if even such wicked people could be brought to the path of religion, what could be greater? Nityananda went to the two brothers and said, "Brothers, chant the holy name of Hari. The name of Hari is very sweet." Jagai and Madhai became very angry and came charging at Nityananda to beat him.

The next day, Jagai and Madhai encountered Nityananda again. This time, they were drunk in broad daylight. Blocking Nityananda's path, they said, "Who are you? Do you have a fancy for chanting the holy name?" Nityananda, smiling, replied, "Brothers, give up poison and partake in the nectar." In a fit of rage, Madhai threw a shard of a broken pot lying nearby.

Immediately, his head was split open, and blood began to flow profusely. Hearing the news, Sri Chaitanya rushed over. Seeing his devotee in such distress, he lost his composure. In a fit of rage, he shouted, "Wretched! How dare you, being a Brahmin's son, do this? If you harm a devotee, even God does not spare you from punishment!"

Saying this, with a thunderous roar, he declared, "Sudarsana, Sudarsana!" Immediately, from somewhere, a fearsome and blazing ball of fire, Vishnu's Sudarsana Chakra, came rushing. Nityananda realized that he had to appease the Lord's anger, or else there would be chaos.

He quickly came forward, holding the weapon in his hands, and said, "What are you doing, Lord? You had promised not to wield the discus in the Kali Yuga. You must keep your word. Please withdraw the Sudarsana Chakra and forgive these two fools." Hearing these words from his devotee, Sri Chaitanya calmed down.

Seeing everything, Jagai and Madhai fell silent. They approached Nityananda and Mahaprabhu with folded hands. From then on, they both engaged in chanting the holy names of Hari, traveling from village to village. Inspired by their example, even the local drunks and ruffians turned to the path of dharma.

In the holy abode of Navadvipa, the Lord was born,

In Katwa, the Lord's sacred place you must surely know.

The birthplace of Ekachakra and residence in Khardaha,

And Nityananda's two sacred abodes, know them well.
