Seven hundred years ago, the land we now know as Sylhet was part of the Gaur kingdom, called Srihatta at the time. This kingdom was shrouded in mystery, whispered to be a haven for sorcerers since ancient times. Even the king, Gaur Govinda, himself wielded magical powers. He was also a staunch Hindu, intolerant of other religions. One of his most unbending laws was the complete ban on cow slaughter within his realm.

One day, King Govinda was enjoying the peace of his palace balcony when a crow landed nearby, a piece of meat stuck to its beak. The morsel tumbled down, landing right at the king's feet. It didn't take King Govinda long to realize the horrifying truth; the meat was beef. Fury consumed him, and he demanded the immediate capture of the culprit. After days of relentless search, the offender was identified: Sheikh Burhanuddin, a humble resident of Tulkikar. Burhanuddin, blessed with a child late in life after years of fervent prayers, had dared to slaughter a cow for his son's "Akika" ceremony, a blatant disregard for the king's law. This act of defiance sealed his fate, leading to his downfall.

Burhanuddin, accused of the forbidden act of cow-slaughter, was dragged before the king's court. Found guilty, he was subjected to a barbaric punishment – his right hand was to be severed from his body. As if this cruelty wasn't enough, the merciless king demanded the execution of Burhanuddin's innocent son as well. With his hand ruthlessly chopped off and his heart shattered by the loss of his child, Burhanuddin sought justice. He journeyed to the court of Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah, his voice filled with sorrow and anger as he recounted the horrific events. The Sultan, overwhelmed by the injustice Burhanuddin had endured, vowed to bring the tyrant king Gaur Govinda to his knees. He entrusted his own nephew, Sikandar Khan Ghazi, with the important task of leading an army against Gaur Govinda's kingdom.

Despite attacking Gaur Govinda's kingdom twice, the brave Sikandar Khan Ghazi was forced to retreat due to the king's magical powers. Undeterred, the Sultan sent his skilled general, Syed Nasiruddin Shah, to conquer the tyrant. On Nasiruddin's way to invade, he met Hazrat Shah Jalal, who was equally appalled by Burhanuddin's tragic story. Deeply moved, Hazrat Shah Jalal joined the expedition with his followers, determined to bring justice.

Together, they journeyed towards Srihatta with the Sultan's army. Upon reaching the Brahmaputra River, they found all boats destroyed, leaving them stranded. However, this did not deter Hazrat Shah Jalal. He and his companions, unwavering in their faith, used their flying prayer mats to cross the mighty river. But their journey wasn't without peril. As they reached the middle, the king's sorcerers unleashed a barrage of fiery arrows. Reacting swiftly, Hazrat Shah Jalal countered their attack with a powerful spell, shrouding themselves in a thick, impenetrable fog. Shielded from harm, they continued their journey and eventually reached the banks of the Barak River. With unwavering resolve, they employed their prayer mats once again, successfully crossing the final obstacle.

King Gaur Govinda, realizing his impending defeat, sought escape through a tunnel called "[Harang Hurong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harong_Hurong)." However, the tunnel harbored a chilling myth. It was believed to be the dwelling place of 33 crore deities, and no one who dared to enter had ever returned alive. Such was the terror surrounding the tunnel that even venturing near it was considered taboo. Desperate and cornered, the king made his way towards the tunnel. Recognizing the gravity of his situation, he offered a singular Taka to each of the 33 crore deities, hoping to appease them and ensure his safe passage. Whether his act of appeasement or sheer luck played a role, none can say for certain, but the king emerged from the other end of the tunnel, escaping the clutches of defeat.
