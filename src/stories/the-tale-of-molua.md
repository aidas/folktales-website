At that time, the country was going through an unseasonal period of rain. The autumn paddy was being destroyed by the downpour. During this time, a widow and her son, Chand Binod, were struggling to survive. In search of some extra income, Binod took up hunting kites or eagles. One day, he went to the pond bank in the village of Aralia to hunt kites. As he became exhausted while hunting, he sat under a tree to rest and soon fell asleep. Evening was approaching then. At that moment, Molua, the young daughter of the village chief in Aralia, came to the riverbank to fetch water.

As Binod slept, evening approached.  

"Who are you, sleeping alone by the riverbank?"  

The sister of seven brothers, Molua, came to fetch water,  

While the young man lay alone at the water's edge.

Seeing him lying under the tree, her heart filled with compassion. She thought, "If his sleep breaks in the middle of the night, where will this foreign traveler go?" Molua wondered where this young man would stay during the night. So, she tapped her water pitcher to make a sound, hoping the noise would wake him from his slumber.

Binod awoke to find a beautiful young woman standing before him in the dim evening light. Her beauty seemed to brighten the surroundings like the evening lamp. Seeing her, Binod was both astonished and enchanted. He asked, "Whose daughter are you—whose woman—where is your home?" In response, Molua revealed her identity. Upon learning her identity, Binod surrendered his heart to her. Expressing his deep affection, he said, "I’ve left my soul here at this riverbank!"

On the other hand, the young woman Molua was no less captivated. She, too, had fallen for Binod. Seeing his moon-like beautiful face, a wave of spring passed through her heart. She thought to herself:

"A foreign man, like the moon I see,  

Blushes bloomed on the maiden's youth, tender and free."

Enchanted by Molua's beauty, Binod expressed his desire to marry her and sent a matchmaker to her home through his mother. However, this is where the trouble began. Molua’s father objected to the marriage because of Binod's poor status. Although he initially refused, he later agreed. Binod married Molua, and she moved to his home. There, her beauty caught the lustful eyes of the local kazi, who became infatuated with her.

The kazi tried to tempt her, saying, "Seeing your beauty, the kazi has become obsessed. I will fill your body with pure gold." In protest, Molua boldly replied, "My husband isn't home, or I would tell you—if he were, I’d strike your cunning head with a broom!"

The furious kazi, determined to control Molua, began persecuting Binod. He auctioned off Binod's property and issued a warrant in his name. He demanded a dowry for the marriage and threatened to confiscate their home and land. Despite her family’s dire situation, Molua remained steadfast in her resolve. Binod, feeling weakened by the pressure, asked Molua to return to her father’s house. But Molua dismissed the idea and firmly told Binod:

"Even if I eat simple greens and rice, and live under a tree,  

At the end of the day, seeing your face will make me happy."

Molua continued to endure extreme hardship. One day, Binod returned home after earning some money abroad, and their once happy life resumed. Days were going well, but the kazi still couldn't forget Molua. Upon hearing of Binod's return, the kazi sought to intensify the pressure on Molua and enlisted the local Dewan to help. The Dewan, following the kazi's orders, plotted to torture Binod and have him buried alive.

Upon learning of the plot, Molua summoned her five brothers using their trained kites, and they rescued Binod. Though Binod was freed, the kazi's men captured Molua and presented her as a gift to the Dewan. When the Dewan expressed his desire to marry her, Molua, holding firm to her principles, told him about a vow she had taken and asked him to wait for three months.

Molua endured all the sorrows, hardships, and suffering in her life with a smile, thanks to Binod's love. However, even after escaping from the Dewan's control, Binod's relatives questioned her chastity. Furthermore, influenced by their words, Binod also began to doubt Molua, accusing her of being unworthy to join the family after spending three months in another man's house. Eventually, Binod abandoned her, and their society refused to accept her as well.

Though Molua's brothers wanted to take her away, she remained in Binod's home, like a servant. Meanwhile, Binod remarried. One day, when Binod was bitten by a snake, Molua took him to a healer and saved his life. Witnessing this, all the neighbors urged Binod to bring Molua back into his home.

In the east, a storm roared fiercely.  

There are no shores, no landing places by this sea.  

“Let it sink, let it sink, how much farther can it go?  

As I drown, I see how far the underworld is.”  

The storm raged fiercely in the east,  

Where did the beautiful girl, the boat of the mind and heart, go?  

Thus ends the tale of Molua,  

A tragic story from the Mymensingh Gitika
