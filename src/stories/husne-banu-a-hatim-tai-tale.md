Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Khorasan, there ruled a king named Khurdan Shah. He had five hundred thousand horses in his stables. In front of and behind the palace, there were ten thousand chariots along with a multitude of swordsmen, guards, and archers. People said that in his realm, even tigers and sheep drank water together, such was the justice of this king. Throughout the kingdom, only his fame and tales of compassion circulated from mouth to mouth among the people.

In this kingdom of Khorasan lived a merchant named Barzakh. The merchant lacked for nothing in wealth and riches. While he was not a king, he held himself with the same grandeur as one. He shared a close bond with Khurdan Shah. So, when the merchant passed away, he entrusted all the responsibilities of his beloved only daughter, Husne Banur, to the king. The king accepted her as if she were his own daughter.

Husne Banur was unmatched in beauty and talents. Everyone praised her for her knowledge and wit. After her father's death, the responsibility of the kingdom fell upon her shoulders. However, being a young woman, she was not short of suitors eager to marry her. Almost daily, she was harassed by a crowd of princes and merchant sons, leaving her no peace. Frustrated, Husne Banur approached her nursemaid and said, "Nurse, I do not want to marry right now. I wish to manage the business properly. What should I do?" The nurse then provided her with the clues to seven riddles and warned her that only if someone could solve all seven riddles should she accept him as a husband.

The seven riddles were as follows:

1. Once you see someone, you desire to see them again and again.

2. Do good deeds and throw them into the sea.

3. As you sow, so shall you reap.

4. Truth is peace.

5. Bring news from the mountain that speaks, that is the Kohinor.

6. I want a pearl as large as a duck's egg.

7. Fate’s writing cannot be undone; is this true? Or does a person's labor also have value? (Alternatively, “Ask him to bring the calculation for the bath of the tailor!”)

Husne Banu was having a difficult time with the seven riddles, as no one could solve them or complete the tasks she had given. One day, while looking out of the palace window, she saw a dervish. From a distance, the dervish appeared very kind and noble, so Husne Banu invited him into the palace. However, she was unaware of the true intentions of this dervish named Azrak. He was actually the leader of the forty thieves, and that very night, he planned to raid Husne Banu's palace and steal all her wealth. When Husne Banu later went to the king to seek justice, no one believed her. Even the king exiled her.

Overwhelmed with sorrow, Husne Banu set off on a journey deep into the forest with her nursemaid. Exhausted and heartbroken, they both wept under the shade of a grand tree until they fell into a deep sleep. In her dreams, an ethereal figure appeared to Husne Banu, radiating light and wisdom. He spoke to her, “Dear Husne Banu, the tree under which you rest holds the treasure of seven kingdoms! It is yours to claim. Use this wealth to build a new city here, one that will bring prosperity and joy.”

Awakening from the dream, Husne Banu and her nursemaid, inspired by the vision, began digging under the tree with simple wooden sticks. To their astonishment, glittering jewels, gold, and treasures from seven palaces emerged from the earth. It was a bounty so abundant that it could sustain seven generations in luxury and comfort!

Pieces of golden discs, jewel-encrusted chests, cups brimming with rubies and emeralds, and pearls as large as duck eggs—everything lay glittering before them! Husne Banu did not disregard the divine command. She immediately sent her nursemaid to summon the kingdom’s finest blacksmiths, potters, and masons.

But to build a new city in the kingdom, she needed the king’s permission! Who would bring that permission? The king had already misunderstood and banished her. Yet Husne Banu was not one to give up. Disguised as a merchant, with fists full of rubies and emeralds and a golden chest strapped to her horse, she set out. The determined youth strode straight into the king’s court. The king, seeing this newcomer, immediately inquired, “Who are you, young man? What do you seek in this kingdom?”

Husne Banu introduced herself as Mahru Shah, a foreign merchant. She presented gifts to the king and requested permission to stay at the house of Barzakh the merchant. The king, known for his generosity, hesitated briefly but eventually granted her request, saying, “Merchant, you should know that house is my son’s favorite! But since you ask, go ahead and stay there.”

In that very court, disguised among the courtiers, was the bandit Azrak, still masquerading as a dervish. He had already looted Barzakh’s house once and never been caught. His tongue practically dripped with greed, and his eyes burned with the fire of desire. He thought, _This merchant must be plundered too!_ But little did Azrak know that Husne Banu was already plotting a trap for him, and it wouldn’t be long before he fell right into it!

That very day, Mahru Shah (Husne Banu in disguise) invited the dervish and his forty disciples to the palace for a grand feast. While feasting, the dervish, Azrak, discreetly scoped out the merchant’s treasures, his mind swirling with schemes. _Tonight, no matter what, everything must be seized!_ he decided. Without delay, he returned home and shared every detail of the plan with his forty followers. Yet, little did Azrak know that at the same time, Mahru Shah was alerting her guards and making arrangements with the royal constable, preparing for whatever might come.

In the dead of night, Azrak and his forty thieves silently crept into Barzakh’s palace once more. But the moment Azrak slipped the ruby necklace from the goblet around his neck, the band of robbers found themselves surrounded from all sides. There was no escape, no way out.

The next morning, Azrak and his forty thieves were presented one by one in the royal court. The sight of the "dervish" standing among the captured robbers left the king completely stunned. Rubbing his eyes in disbelief, he tried to process the truth. At that moment, Mahru Shah stepped forward, holding up the very ruby necklace that adorned the dervish's neck—the same kind of ruby Mahru Shah had given the king as a gift. The whole court finally understood the deception, and Azrak’s wickedness and disguise were fully revealed. Mahru Shah then cast off the merchant disguise, emerging as the beautiful and clever Husne Banu.

Realizing his mistake, the king embraced his beloved foster daughter, Husne Banu, with heartfelt regret and pride. Husne Banu then revealed to the king the secret of the cave in the jungle, filled with priceless treasures. Eager to reclaim the wealth, the king sent his men to retrieve the gems and jewels. But alas! As soon as they approached the cave, the treasure vanished into thin air, and a venomous snake rose up, hissing fiercely. Husne Banu could not comprehend the meaning of this strange occurrence, but the wise old king understood. He gently told Husne Banu, “These riches are rightfully yours, my daughter! They will yield to no one else.”

Now, the king joined Husne Banu in building her new city. Leaving the royal palace behind, he spent seven days alongside her, erecting a grand new palace. In this palace, weary and thirsty travelers found shelter and nourishment for years to come. The tale of Husne Banu's kindness spread far and wide. She became the beloved jewel in everyone’s eyes, residing in that enchanting city nestled deep within the forest.
